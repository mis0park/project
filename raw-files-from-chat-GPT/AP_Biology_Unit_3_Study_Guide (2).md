- `inline code` → technical terms, structures, or labels
- > blockquotes → AP boundaries or interpretive rules
- **Bold** → reserved for absolute must-know ideas only

# TOPIC 3.1 — Enzymes

## What Is an Enzyme?
An enzyme is a **protein catalyst** that increases reaction rate by lowering the
energy barrier between reactants and products, without being consumed.

> AP boundary: enzymes do **not** change ΔG or reaction direction

---

## What Is a Gibbs Free Energy Diagram?

A Gibbs free energy diagram visualizes **energetic feasibility**, not speed.

```
Free Energy (G)
│            /\   ← activation energy (Ea)
│           /  │  ________/    \_______
│ Reactants        Products
└────────────────────────── Reaction progress
```

### How to Interpret
- Y-axis (`G`) → usable energy in the system
- X-axis → reaction progress (not time)
- Peak height → activation energy
- Start vs end → `ΔG` (energy released or required)

### Key Interpretive Rules
- Enzymes ↓ activation energy
- Enzymes ≠ change `ΔG`
- Exergonic reactions `(ΔG < 0)` release energy
- Endergonic reactions `(ΔG > 0)` require coupling

> AP Exam focus: *reading* energy diagrams, not calculating ΔG

---

## How Enzymes Lower Activation Energy (Mechanism)

Enzymes:
- orient substrates correctly
- strain existing bonds
- stabilize the transition state
- create favorable microenvironments (pH, polarity)

### Induced Fit (Why Shape Matters)
Active site changes conformation *after* substrate binding,
increasing catalytic efficiency.

---

## Light Reasoning Prompt (Optional)
Why does lowering activation energy increase reaction rate but not affect
equilibrium position?

---

# TOPIC 3.2 — Environmental Impacts on Enzyme Function

## What Is Denaturation?
Denaturation is the loss of a protein’s **three-dimensional structure**
due to disruption of hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, or disulfide bridges.

Result → active site shape altered → loss of function

---

## Temperature vs pH (Comparison)

| Factor | What changes physically | Why activity drops |
|------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| Temperature | molecular motion | bonds break at high T |
| pH | R-group charge | active site reshaped |

---

## What Are Enzyme Inhibitors?

| Type | Binding site | Effect |
|----|----|----|
| Competitive | active site | substrate competition |
| Noncompetitive | allosteric | shape change |

> AP Exam: mechanism, not kinetics graphs

---

# TOPIC 3.3 — Cellular Energy

## What Does “Energy” Mean in Biology?
Energy = capacity to do work (drive chemical reactions, transport, movement)

Living systems:
- maintain internal order
- export entropy to surroundings
- require constant energy input

---

## What Is Energy Coupling?
Energy coupling links:
- an exergonic reaction (energy-releasing)
- to an endergonic reaction (energy-requiring)

ATP acts as the intermediary.

```
ATP → ADP + Pi + energy
```

---

## Comparison: Spontaneous vs Nonspontaneous

| Feature | Exergonic | Endergonic |
|------|----------|------------|
| ΔG | negative | positive |
| Energy | released | required |
| Needs coupling? | no | yes |

---

## Light Reasoning Prompt
Why must cells constantly regenerate ATP instead of storing large amounts?

---

# TOPIC 3.4 — Photosynthesis

## What Is Photosynthesis (Conceptually)?
Photosynthesis converts **light energy → chemical energy**
via electron flow and proton gradients.

Overall logic:
light → excited electrons → proton gradient → ATP/NADPH → sugar

---

## Chloroplast Architecture (Why Structure Matters)

| Region | Function |
|------|----------|
| Thylakoid membrane | light reactions |
| Thylakoid lumen | high H⁺ |
| Stroma | Calvin cycle |

---

## Light Reactions (Mechanism Walkthrough)

1. `Photosystem II`
   - light excites electrons
   - water splits → O₂ + H⁺ + e⁻
2. `Electron Transport Chain`
   - electron energy pumps protons
3. `Photosystem I`
   - electrons re-energized
   - NADP⁺ → NADPH
4. `ATP synthase`
   - proton flow drives ATP formation

> AP Exam: proton gradient logic  
> Not required: individual ETC protein names

---

## What Is the Calvin Cycle Really Doing?
The Calvin cycle uses ATP + NADPH to **reduce CO₂ into sugar precursors**.

### Phases (for understanding)
- Carbon fixation (`RuBisCO`)
- Reduction
- Regeneration of RuBP

> AP Exam: *function*, not enzyme memorization

---

## Comparison: Light Reactions vs Calvin Cycle

| Feature | Light Reactions | Calvin Cycle |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Location | thylakoid membrane | stroma |
| Input | light, H₂O | CO₂, ATP, NADPH |
| Output | ATP, NADPH, O₂ | G3P |

---

# TOPIC 3.5 — Cellular Respiration

## What Is Cellular Respiration?
A controlled process for extracting energy from organic molecules
to generate ATP via proton gradients.

---

## Mitochondrial Structure–Function

| Region | Role |
|------|------|
| Matrix | Krebs cycle |
| Inner membrane | ETC |
| Intermembrane space | high H⁺ |

---

## ETC and Chemiosmosis (Mechanism)

1. NADH/FADH₂ donate electrons
2. Electron energy pumps protons
3. O₂ accepts electrons → H₂O
4. Proton gradient drives ATP synthase

> This mechanism is conserved across life

---

## Comparison: Photosynthesis ETC vs Respiration ETC

| Feature | Photosynthesis | Respiration |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Location | thylakoid | inner mitochondrial membrane |
| Electron source | H₂O | NADH/FADH₂ |
| Final acceptor | NADP⁺ | O₂ |
| Gradient purpose | ATP synthesis | ATP synthesis |

---

## Fermentation — Why It Exists
Fermentation regenerates `NAD⁺` when oxygen is absent,
allowing glycolysis to continue.

---

## Big Unifying Idea (AP Gold)
**Electrons flow → gradients form → gradients do work**

This logic applies to:
- enzymes
- photosynthesis
- respiration
- evolution of metabolism
