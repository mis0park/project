## Mega Comparison Table: Organelles (Academic, One Page)

| Structure | What it is | Made of (major components) | Primary function | Consequence if absent | Cells/tissues with high abundance | Key diagram labels |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ribosome` | A ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for protein synthesis. | ribosomal RNA (`rRNA`), ribosomal proteins | Translates `mRNA` sequences into polypeptide chains. | Protein synthesis ceases, leading to loss of cellular function. | Secretory cells (pancreatic acinar cells, plasma cells) | large subunit, small subunit, `mRNA` |
| `rough ER` | A membranous network continuous with the nuclear envelope, bearing bound ribosomes. | phospholipid bilayer, bound ribosomes, lumenal proteins | Synthesizes and begins processing proteins destined for secretion or membranes. | Secretory and membrane proteins are improperly synthesized or processed. | Antibody‑secreting immune cells, glandular cells | ribosomes, ER lumen |
| `smooth ER` | A membranous network lacking bound ribosomes. | phospholipid bilayer, embedded enzymes | Synthesizes lipids, detoxifies harmful substances, and stores Ca²⁺ ions. | Lipid synthesis and detoxification are impaired; Ca²⁺ regulation is disrupted. | Hepatocytes, muscle cells | smooth tubules |
| `Golgi apparatus` | A stack of flattened membranous sacs involved in post‑ER processing. | phospholipid bilayers, processing enzymes | Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for transport. | Cellular products fail to reach correct destinations. | Gland cells, neurons | cis face, trans face, vesicles |
| `lysosome` | A membrane‑bound vesicle containing digestive enzymes. | phospholipid bilayer, hydrolytic enzymes | Degrades macromolecules and recycles cellular components. | Waste accumulation and failure of intracellular recycling occur. | Immune cells (macrophages) | acidic lumen |
| `vacuole` | A membrane‑bound compartment primarily involved in storage. | phospholipid bilayer, aqueous contents | Stores water, ions, and other substances; maintains turgor pressure in plants. | Plant cells lose rigidity and structural support. | Plant cells | central vacuole |
| `mitochondrion` | A double‑membrane organelle that generates ATP. | outer membrane, inner membrane with `cristae`, proteins, lipids | Produces ATP via cellular respiration and chemiosmosis. | Cellular energy production collapses. | Muscle cells, neurons | `matrix`, inner membrane, intermembrane space |
| `chloroplast` | A double‑membrane organelle specialized for photosynthesis. | outer/inner membranes, thylakoid membranes, pigments, enzymes | Converts light energy into chemical energy stored in sugars. | Photosynthesis cannot occur. | Leaf mesophyll cells | `stroma`, thylakoid, grana |
| `nucleus` | A membrane‑bound compartment that houses genetic material. | double phospholipid bilayer, nuclear pores, chromatin | Stores DNA and regulates transcription. | Gene expression becomes unregulated or impossible. | Eukaryotic cells | nuclear envelope, pores |
| `plasma membrane` | A selectively permeable boundary surrounding the cell. | phospholipid bilayer, integral proteins, peripheral proteins, carbohydrates, cholesterol (animals) | Regulates transport and mediates cell signaling. | Cellular contents leak and homeostasis is lost. | All cells | bilayer, transport proteins |
| `cell wall` | A rigid external layer providing structural support. | cellulose (plants), chitin (fungi), peptidoglycan (bacteria) | Protects cells and prevents osmotic lysis. | Cells are vulnerable to osmotic stress. | Plants, fungi, bacteria | wall exterior to membrane |

# UNIT 2: CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

## 2.1 Cell Structure and Function

### Structure–function relationship
In AP Biology, a structure–function relationship explains how physical features of a cellular component enable its biological role. Alteration of structure leads to altered function.

Example: Increased folding of the inner mitochondrial membrane increases surface area available for electron transport and ATP synthesis.

---

## 2.2 Cell Size and Constraints

### Surface area–to–volume ratio
As cell size increases, volume increases more rapidly than surface area, reducing the efficiency of exchange with the environment.

### Biological solutions
- Maintaining small cell size  
- Altering shape to increase surface area  
- Adding membrane folds or compartments  

---

## 2.3 Plasma Membrane

### Fluid mosaic model
The plasma membrane is a dynamic structure composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins and associated carbohydrates. Components move laterally within the membrane.

### Membrane components (functional view)

| Component | Functional role |
|---|---|
| phospholipids | form selectively permeable barrier |
| integral proteins | transport, signaling |
| peripheral proteins | structural support, enzymatic roles |
| carbohydrates | cell recognition |
| cholesterol (animals) | membrane fluidity regulation |

---

## 2.4 Membrane Permeability

Selective permeability arises from the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer, which restricts ions and polar molecules while allowing small nonpolar molecules to diffuse.

---

## 2.5 Membrane Transport

### Transport mechanisms (summary)

| Mechanism | Energy requirement | Direction relative to gradient |
|---|---|---|
| simple diffusion | none | down |
| facilitated diffusion | none | down |
| active transport | ATP or gradient | against |
| endocytosis/exocytosis | ATP | bulk transport |

---

## 2.6 Facilitated Diffusion

Channels provide hydrophilic pathways for ions or water, while carriers bind specific solutes and undergo conformational change to transport them.

---

## 2.7 Tonicity and Osmoregulation

Tonicity describes the relative solute concentration of a solution and predicts the direction of water movement across a semipermeable membrane.

---

## 2.8 Mechanisms of Transport

The `Na⁺/K⁺ pump` uses ATP to establish ion gradients that contribute to membrane potential and secondary active transport.

---

## 2.9 Cell Compartmentalization

Membrane‑bound compartments allow cells to maintain distinct internal environments, increasing efficiency and regulation of metabolic processes.

---

## 2.10 Origins of Cell Compartmentalization

### Endosymbiotic theory
The presence of double membranes, circular DNA, and bacterial‑like ribosomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts supports their origin from engulfed prokaryotes.
