# TOPIC 3.1 — Enzymes

## CED Core Ideas
- Enzymes are **protein catalysts** that lower activation energy.
- Enzyme specificity depends on **shape and charge** of the active site.
- Enzyme–substrate complex formation explains catalysis.

## OpenStax Expansion (Conceptual Depth)
- Enzymes **do not change ΔG** of reactions; they change the *rate*.
- Activation energy is lowered by:
  - Proper substrate **orientation**
  - **Strain** on bonds
  - **Microenvironment** (pH, polarity)
- Induced-fit model: active site **changes shape** after substrate binding.

## Diagrams to Draw
1. **Energy vs. Reaction Progress Graph**
   - Two curves: with enzyme (lower peak), without enzyme (higher peak)
   - Same starting and ending energy
2. **Enzyme–Substrate Interaction**
   - Label: active site, substrate, enzyme–substrate complex, products
   - Show induced fit (active site tightening)

## AP Exam Focus
✔ Activation energy  
✔ Enzyme specificity  
✘ Enzyme kinetics equations (Km, Vmax)

# TOPIC 3.2 — Environmental Impacts on Enzyme Function

## CED Core Ideas
- Enzyme structure can be altered by **temperature, pH, chemicals**.
- Denaturation disrupts hydrogen bonds → loss of function.
- Competitive vs. noncompetitive inhibitors affect enzymes differently.

## OpenStax Expansion
- **Temperature**
  - Higher temp → higher kinetic energy → more collisions
  - Too high → denaturation
- **pH**
  - Alters charge of amino acid R-groups
  - Active site shape changes
- **Inhibitors**
  - Competitive: bind active site
  - Noncompetitive: bind allosteric site → shape change

## Diagrams to Draw
1. **Reaction Rate vs. Temperature Curve**
   - Bell-shaped curve with optimal temperature
2. **Competitive vs Noncompetitive Inhibition**
   - Side-by-side enzyme diagrams
   - Label inhibitor binding sites

## AP Exam Focus
✔ Effects of environment on enzyme function  
✔ Inhibitor comparisons  
✘ Detailed enzyme chemistry

# TOPIC 3.3 — Cellular Energy

## CED Core Ideas
- Living systems require **constant energy input**.
- Energy flow obeys **1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics**.
- Metabolic pathways are **sequential and regulated**.
- Core pathways are **evolutionarily conserved**.

## OpenStax Expansion
- Cells maintain order by exporting entropy.
- Coupled reactions:
  - Exergonic → drive endergonic
- ATP:
  - Energy stored in phosphate bonds
  - Hydrolysis releases usable energy

## Diagrams to Draw
1. **ATP Cycle**
   - ATP ↔ ADP + Pi
   - Energy input/output arrows
2. **Metabolic Pathway Flow**
   - Substrate → intermediate → product
   - Enzyme at each step

## AP Exam Focus
✔ Energy coupling  
✔ ATP as energy currency  
✘ Gibbs free energy equation

# TOPIC 3.4 — Photosynthesis

## CED Core Ideas
- Photosynthesis converts light energy → chemical energy.
- Occurs in **chloroplasts** (thylakoids + stroma).
- Light reactions produce **ATP and NADPH**.
- Calvin cycle uses ATP/NADPH to fix CO₂.

## OpenStax Expansion
### Light Reactions
- Occur in thylakoid membrane
- Photosystem II:
  - Light excites electrons
  - Water splits → O₂ + H⁺ + e⁻
- ETC creates proton gradient
- ATP synthase produces ATP (photophosphorylation)

### Calvin Cycle
- Occurs in stroma
- Carbon fixation → reduction → regeneration
- Produces G3P (sugar precursor)

## Diagrams to Draw
1. **Chloroplast Structure**
   - Outer membrane, inner membrane, stroma, grana
2. **Thylakoid Membrane ETC**
   - Photosystem II → ETC → Photosystem I → NADPH
   - Proton gradient + ATP synthase
3. **Photosynthesis Overview**
   - Inputs: CO₂, H₂O, light
   - Outputs: sugar, O₂

## AP Exam Focus
✔ Location of reactions  
✔ Proton gradient & ATP synthase  
✘ Enzyme names in Calvin cycle (except ATP synthase)

# TOPIC 3.5 — Cellular Respiration

## CED Core Ideas
- Cellular respiration harvests energy from macromolecules.
- Occurs in **mitochondria** (eukaryotes).
- ETC creates proton gradient → ATP synthesis.
- Fermentation allows glycolysis without oxygen.

## OpenStax Expansion
### Glycolysis
- Cytosol
- Glucose → pyruvate
- Produces ATP + NADH

### Krebs Cycle
- Mitochondrial matrix
- Releases CO₂
- Produces NADH, FADH₂

### Electron Transport Chain
- Inner mitochondrial membrane
- Electrons flow to O₂ (final acceptor)
- Proton gradient powers ATP synthase
- Oxidative phosphorylation

### Fermentation
- Regenerates NAD⁺
- No ETC, no additional ATP

## Diagrams to Draw
1. **Mitochondrion Structure**
   - Outer membrane, inner membrane, cristae, matrix
2. **Cellular Respiration Overview**
   - Glycolysis → Krebs → ETC
   - Location + major outputs
3. **Chemiosmosis**
   - Proton gradient + ATP synthase

## AP Exam Focus
✔ Proton gradient & chemiosmosis  
✔ Comparison of aerobic vs anaerobic  
✘ Step-by-step pathway memorization

## Big Picture Connections (Exam Gold)
- Photosynthesis and respiration are **complementary**.
- ETC and chemiosmosis appear in **both chloroplasts and mitochondria**.
- Energy flow is conserved across life → **common ancestry**.
