# UNIT 2: CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

## 2.1 Cell Structure and Function

### Big picture
Cells are systems: internal parts have specialized jobs, and those jobs depend on physical structure.

### What is “structure–function” (AP Bio meaning)?
A structure–function claim says a feature exists because it enables a job; changing the feature changes the job.
Example: `cristae` increase inner membrane surface area → more ETC/`ATP synthase` sites → higher ATP capacity.

---

### Core organelles: standard table set

#### `ribosome`
| Aspect | Explanation |
|---|---|
| What it is | protein-building machine |
| Made of | `rRNA` + proteins |
| What it does | translates `mRNA` into polypeptide |
| If lost | protein synthesis fails → cell death |
| Especially abundant in | plasma cells; pancreas (enzyme secretion) |

---

### The endomembrane system as a *process* (shipping logic)
`nucleus → rough ER → transport vesicle → Golgi → vesicle → plasma membrane`

#### What breaks if this system breaks?
- secreted proteins don’t get processed or delivered
- membrane proteins don’t reach correct membranes
- cell-to-cell signaling can fail

> AP focus: *flow + purpose*. Not required: detailed glycosylation chemistry.

#### Reasoning prompt
If vesicles cannot fuse with the plasma membrane, which process fails first: secretion or protein synthesis? Explain.

---

## 2.2 Cell Size

### Surface area–to–volume ratio (SA:V)
As cells get larger, volume increases faster than surface area → exchange becomes inefficient.

#### Solutions cells use
- remain small
- change shape (flatten/elongate)
- add folds (`microvilli`, `cristae`)

#### Mini-table: constraint → solution
| Constraint | Why it matters | Common solution |
|---|---|---|
| low SA:V | slow nutrient/waste exchange | folds (microvilli) |
| long diffusion distance | slow internal transport | streaming/compartments |
| high demand for ATP | energy bottleneck | more mitochondria/cristae |

#### Reasoning prompt
Why do intestinal epithelial cells have `microvilli`? Use SA:V logic.

---

## 2.3 Plasma Membrane

### What is the fluid mosaic model?
Membrane = dynamic bilayer with moving components (lipids + proteins + carbs; cholesterol in animals).

#### Membrane components and roles
| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| phospholipids | barrier + fluidity |
| integral proteins | transport/receptors |
| peripheral proteins | support/signaling |
| carbohydrates | recognition (`glycoprotein`) |
| cholesterol (animals) | tunes fluidity |

> AP boundary: know *cholesterol affects fluidity*, not exact temperature curves.

---

## 2.4 Membrane Permeability

### Selective permeability (why some things cross)
- small nonpolar (`O₂`, `CO₂`) diffuse through
- ions (`Na⁺`, `K⁺`) and large polar (glucose) need proteins

#### Quick table: who crosses?
| Crosses easily | Needs help |
|---|---|
| small nonpolar gases | ions (`Na⁺`, `K⁺`, `Cl⁻`) |
| small hydrophobic | large polar molecules |
| limited small polar | most polar molecules |

---

## 2.5 Membrane Transport

### What is an electrochemical gradient?
For ions, “downhill” depends on both concentration and charge differences.

### Transport mechanisms (core table)
| Mechanism | Energy | Direction | Typical examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| simple diffusion | none | down gradient | `O₂`, `CO₂` |
| osmosis | none | water potential gradient | `H₂O` |
| facilitated diffusion | none | down gradient | glucose transporters; ion channels |
| primary active transport | ATP | against gradient | `Na⁺/K⁺ pump` |
| secondary active transport | gradient energy | one down, one up | `Na⁺`-glucose cotransport |
| endocytosis | ATP | bulk in | phagocytosis |
| exocytosis | ATP | bulk out | secretion |

#### Reasoning prompt
Why can glucose move “passively” through a membrane protein but not through the lipid bilayer?

---

## 2.6 Facilitated Diffusion

### Channels vs carriers (must distinguish)
| Feature | `channel` | `carrier` |
|---|---|---|
| How it works | pore pathway | shape-change cycle |
| Speed | very fast | slower |
| Specificity | often selective | highly specific |
| Saturation | less obvious | strong saturation |

### `aquaporins`
Water channels that greatly speed osmosis.

> AP boundary: know what they are + why they matter; no kinetics math.

---

## 2.7 Tonicity and Osmoregulation

### Tonicity (must know)
- isotonic: no net water movement
- hypotonic: water enters cell
- hypertonic: water leaves cell

#### One table to rule them all
| Environment | Water movement | Animal cell outcome | Plant cell outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| isotonic | no net | normal | flaccid |
| hypotonic | in | swelling/lysis risk | turgid (good) |
| hypertonic | out | shriveled | plasmolyzed |

#### Reasoning prompt
Why does a plant cell not burst in hypotonic solution the way an animal cell might?

---

## 2.8 Mechanisms of Transport

### `Na⁺/K⁺ pump` (primary active transport)
- uses ATP
- `3 Na⁺` out
- `2 K⁺` in
Creates:
- concentration gradients
- electrical gradient (more + outside)

### Secondary active transport (gradient-powered)
A gradient (often `Na⁺`) provides “downhill energy” to move another solute uphill (e.g., glucose).

#### Reasoning prompt
Explain how the `Na⁺/K⁺ pump` can indirectly power glucose uptake without ATP being used by the glucose transporter.

---

## 2.9 Cell Compartmentalization

### Why compartments exist
Compartments allow:
- incompatible reactions at once
- specialized environments (pH/ions)
- pathway efficiency (enzymes clustered)

Key example:
- inner mitochondrial membrane localizes ETC + `ATP synthase`.

---

## 2.10 Origins of Cell Compartmentalization

### Endosymbiotic theory (evidence logic)
| Evidence | Why it supports endosymbiosis |
|---|---|
| double membranes | engulfment event |
| circular DNA | bacterial-like genome |
| bacterial-like ribosomes | shared ancestry |
| independent replication | semi-autonomous origin |

> AP focus: evidence reasoning, not memorizing historical timelines.

---

## Diagrams List (Batch-Drawing Checklist)

### Organelles (labeling)
1. Eukaryotic cell overview (animal) — label: `nucleus`, `rough ER`, `smooth ER`, `Golgi`, `mitochondrion`, `lysosome`, `ribosome`, `plasma membrane`
2. Plant cell overview — add: `cell wall`, `chloroplast`, `central vacuole`

### Trafficking & compartments
3. Endomembrane “shipping line” — `nucleus → rough ER → Golgi → vesicles → membrane`
4. `Golgi` cis→trans with vesicles (incoming vs outgoing destinations)

### Energy-related structures (Unit 3 bridge)
5. `mitochondrion` — label: outer membrane, inner membrane, `cristae`, `matrix`, intermembrane space
6. `chloroplast` — label: outer/inner membrane, `stroma`, thylakoid, grana (stack), lumen (optional)

### Membranes & proteins
7. Phospholipid bilayer cross-section — heads/tails + “hydrophobic core” label
8. Fluid mosaic membrane — include: integral protein, peripheral protein, cholesterol, glycoprotein
9. Channel vs carrier protein — side-by-side (pore vs shape-change)

### Transport & osmosis
10. Endocytosis vs exocytosis — two panels (vesicle in vs vesicle out)
11. Tonicity trio — isotonic/hypotonic/hypertonic with water arrows (animal + plant outcomes)
12. `Na⁺/K⁺ pump` + cotransport — two-step: pump creates gradient, cotransporter uses it

> If you want: I can turn this checklist into a “diagram page” with blank label lines (so you can quiz yourself).

---

## End-of-Unit Mental Model
1) Cells have parts → parts have jobs.  
2) Size creates constraints (SA:V + diffusion).  
3) Membranes create selectivity and gradients.  
4) Transport maintains homeostasis.  
5) Compartments enable complexity.  
6) Endosymbiosis explains key organelles.
