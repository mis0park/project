# AP Biology – UNIT 2 Study Guide
**Cell Structure & Function (Mechanism-Heavy, Diagram-Forward)**  
_Built from your AP Bio CED outline + OpenStax Biology 2e-level detail_

> **Design principle**  
> This unit is basically: **structure → function → constraints → transport → compartments → origins**.  
> Whenever OpenStax assumes you “already know” a term, you’ll see a **“What is X?”** mini-section.

## How to Read & Mark This Guide
- *italics* → soft conceptual emphasis (best default)
- **bold** → absolute anchors (use rarely)
- `inline code` → labels you would put on a diagram (organelles, molecules, transport types)
- > blockquotes → AP boundaries / “don’t over-memorize”

# UNIT 2: CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

## 2.1 Cell Structure and Function

### Big picture (CED)
Cells are systems: internal parts have specialized jobs, and those jobs depend on structure.

---

### What is “structure–function” (in AP Bio terms)?
A structure–function claim says:
- a feature exists because it **enables** a job
- changing the feature changes the job

Example:
- `mitochondrial cristae` = folds that increase membrane surface area → more `ATP synthase` sites → more ATP production.

---

### EK 2.1.A.1 Ribosomes
#### What is a ribosome?
`ribosome` = rRNA + proteins; the machine that translates `mRNA` into a polypeptide.

#### Where are ribosomes?
- free in cytosol → proteins used in cytosol
- bound to `rough ER` → proteins for secretion, membranes, or organelles

> AP focus: ribosomes are universal → common ancestry (don’t memorize ribosomal subunit numbers).

#### Diagram to draw (clean schematic)
- two blobs labeled “large subunit / small subunit”
- `mRNA` thread through
- `tRNA` docking (optional)
- arrow: “polypeptide exits”

---

### EK 2.1.A.2 Endomembrane system
#### What is the endomembrane system?
A coordinated membrane network that **builds → modifies → sorts → ships** cell materials.

Core components:
- `nuclear envelope`
- `rough ER` / `smooth ER`
- `Golgi apparatus`
- `vesicles`
- `lysosomes` / `vacuoles`
- `plasma membrane`

#### What problem does it solve?
Big cells can’t just “let stuff diffuse everywhere.” Compartment + vesicle shipping makes trafficking efficient and controlled.

#### Diagram to draw
A left-to-right “shipping” diagram:
`nucleus → rough ER → transport vesicle → Golgi → secretory vesicle → plasma membrane`

Label the process words:
- “protein synthesis” at ribosome/rough ER
- “modification + sorting” at Golgi
- “exocytosis” at membrane

---

### EK 2.1.A.3 Endoplasmic reticulum
#### Rough ER (RER)
- ribosomes attached
- synthesizes proteins that enter the ER lumen or membrane
- starts folding/processing (like adding tags)

#### Smooth ER (SER)
- lipid synthesis (phospholipids, steroids)
- detoxification
- Ca²⁺ storage (common physiology connection)

> Not AP-tested: detailed detox pathways. Useful: SER is “lipids + detox + storage.”

---

### EK 2.1.A.4 Golgi complex
#### What is the Golgi?
A “post office” stack: modifies, sorts, packages.

Typical flow:
- **cis face** receives from ER
- **trans face** ships out

#### Diagram to draw
- stacked pancakes (cis → trans)
- incoming vesicles from ER on cis side
- outgoing vesicles leaving trans side with different destinations

---

### EK 2.1.A.5 Mitochondria
#### What makes mitochondria special?
- double membrane
- inner membrane folds = `cristae`
- compartments matter:
  - `matrix` (Krebs cycle)
  - `intermembrane space` (H⁺ accumulation)
  - inner membrane (ETC + `ATP synthase`)

#### Why folds matter (mechanism)
More cristae → more inner membrane area → more ETC complexes + ATP synthase → higher ATP capacity.

#### Diagram to draw
- outer membrane oval
- inner membrane squiggle folds
- label: `matrix`, `intermembrane space`, `cristae`

---

### EK 2.1.A.6 Lysosomes
#### What is a lysosome?
A membrane sac with hydrolytic enzymes; works best at acidic pH.

#### What does it do?
- breaks down macromolecules
- recycles parts (cell “recycling center”)
- contributes to programmed cell death (apoptosis context)

> AP boundary: don’t memorize specific lysosomal enzymes.

---

### EK 2.1.A.7 Vacuoles
#### Plant central vacuole
- water + ion storage
- creates **turgor pressure** (rigidity)
- can store pigments/toxins

#### Animal vacuoles
- smaller, more numerous
- storage/transport roles

#### Diagram to draw
Plant cell box with large central vacuole; arrow to “turgor pressure against cell wall.”

---

### EK 2.1.A.8 Chloroplasts
#### Structure–function
- double membrane
- internal thylakoid membranes (for photosynthesis)
- `stroma` vs `thylakoid lumen` differences matter for gradients

> This connects forward to Unit 3 chemiosmosis.

---

### Comparison: Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Cells (high-yield)
| Feature | Prokaryotes | Eukaryotes |
|---|---|---|
| DNA location | nucleoid region | nucleus |
| Organelles | no membrane-bound | many |
| Ribosomes | yes | yes |
| Size | smaller | larger |
| Typical DNA | circular | linear chromosomes |

---

### Light reasoning prompt
If a eukaryotic cell lost its `Golgi apparatus`, what kinds of proteins would be most affected and why?

---

## 2.2 Cell Size

### EK 2.2.A.1 Surface area–to–volume ratio (SA:V)
#### What is SA:V?
- Surface area = how much “exchange interface” you have
- Volume = how much “stuff inside” needs exchange

As size increases:
- volume grows faster than surface area
- SA:V decreases
- diffusion becomes less efficient

#### Why SA:V matters biologically
Limits:
- nutrient uptake
- waste removal
- heat exchange
- signaling speed

#### What solutions do cells use?
- stay small
- change shape (flattening, elongation)
- add folds (microvilli, cristae)

---

### What is “diffusion distance”?
Even if SA is large, long internal distances slow exchange.
Cells solve this with:
- cytoplasmic streaming
- compartmentalization
- organelle placement

---

### Diagram to draw
Two cubes:
- small cube: label “high SA:V”
- large cube: label “low SA:V”
Add arrows showing exchange happening at surfaces.

---

### Light reasoning prompt
Why do intestinal cells have microvilli? Answer using SA:V logic.

---

## 2.3 Plasma Membrane

### EK 2.3.A.1 Phospholipid bilayer
#### What is amphipathic?
`phospholipid` has:
- hydrophilic phosphate head
- hydrophobic fatty acid tails

In water → self-assembles into bilayer to hide hydrophobic tails.

#### Diagram to draw
Classic bilayer:
- heads out, tails in
- label “hydrophobic core”

---

### EK 2.3.A.2 Membrane proteins
Membrane proteins can be:
- integral (span membrane)
- peripheral (surface)

They function as:
- channels/transporters
- receptors
- enzymes
- anchors (cytoskeleton/ECM)

---

### EK 2.3.B.1 Fluid mosaic model
#### What does “fluid” mean?
- lipids & many proteins move laterally
- membrane is dynamic, not rigid

#### What does “mosaic” mean?
Patchwork of lipids + proteins + carbs + cholesterol (animals).

#### Cholesterol (mechanism)
Cholesterol tunes fluidity:
- prevents too rigid at low T
- prevents too fluid at high T

> AP focus: cholesterol affects fluidity; don’t memorize exact temperature curves.

---

### Diagram to draw (like a textbook)
Bilayer with:
- integral protein channel
- peripheral protein
- cholesterol wedges
- carbohydrate chain (glycoprotein)

Label each.

---

## 2.4 Membrane Permeability

### EK 2.4.A.1 Selective permeability
Selective permeability comes from:
- hydrophobic core blocks ions/polar molecules
- small nonpolar molecules diffuse through

### EK 2.4.A.2 Who crosses easily?
| Crosses easily | Needs help |
|---|---|
| `O₂`, `CO₂`, `N₂` | ions (`Na⁺`, `K⁺`, `Cl⁻`) |
| small hydrophobic | large polar (glucose) |
| some small polar (limited) | most polar molecules |

### EK 2.4.A.3 Why ions are blocked
Ions are surrounded by hydration shells → energetically costly to enter hydrophobic core.

---

### EK 2.4.B.1 Cell walls
Cell walls provide:
- structural support
- protection from osmotic lysis
- permeability barrier (some substances)

Different groups, different materials:
- plants: cellulose
- fungi: chitin
- bacteria: peptidoglycan (concept only)

> AP boundary: don’t memorize all chemical structures of wall polymers.

---

## 2.5 Membrane Transport

### EK 2.5.A.1 Gradients
A concentration gradient stores potential energy (like a hill).

### What is an electrochemical gradient?
For ions, “downhill” depends on:
- concentration difference
- electrical charge difference

This is why ion movement affects membrane potential.

---

### EK 2.5.A.2 Passive transport
Passive = no ATP directly.
Types:
- simple diffusion
- osmosis
- facilitated diffusion

### EK 2.5.A.3 Active transport
Active = energy input required.
Moves substances against gradient.

---

### EK 2.5.B.1 Bulk transport
#### Endocytosis
- membrane invaginates
- forms vesicle inward

#### Exocytosis
- vesicle fuses outward
- contents released

#### Diagram to draw
Two-panel:
- endocytosis: membrane folding in, vesicle inside
- exocytosis: vesicle merging, release outside

---

### Comparison: Passive vs Active Transport
| Feature | Passive | Active |
|---|---|---|
| Energy | no ATP | ATP or coupled gradient |
| Direction | down gradient | against gradient |
| Proteins | sometimes | always |
| Examples | diffusion, osmosis | pumps, co-transport |

---

## 2.6 Facilitated Diffusion

### EK 2.6.A.1 Ions need channels
Ions require `channel proteins` or `transporters`.

#### What is polarization?
Unequal distribution of ions → membrane potential difference.

### EK 2.6.A.2 Large polar molecules
Example: glucose transporters move glucose down gradient without ATP.

### EK 2.6.A.3 Aquaporins
`aquaporins` = water channels → rapid osmosis.

---

### What is the difference between channels and carriers?
- `channel`: hollow pathway; very fast; often gated
- `carrier`: changes shape each cycle; slower; saturates

> AP focus: both enable facilitated diffusion. Not required: kinetics graphs.

---

### Diagram to draw
Side-by-side:
- channel protein with pore
- carrier protein changing shape (two conformations)

---

## 2.7 Tonicity and Osmoregulation

### EK 2.7.A.1 Tonicity terms (must know)
- isotonic: equal solute; no net water movement
- hypotonic: outside has less solute → water enters cell
- hypertonic: outside has more solute → water leaves cell

#### What is osmosis (mechanism)?
Water diffuses toward higher solute concentration because that region has lower free water.

> AP wording you’ll see: “water moves from hypotonic → hypertonic.”

---

### What is water potential (when it shows up)?
Water potential describes water movement due to solute + pressure.

> AP may reference the idea; you interpret direction. Don’t over-focus on calculations unless your class does.

---

### EK 2.7.B.1–2 Osmoregulation
Organisms control water/solute balance by:
- transport proteins
- excretion systems (kidney, Malpighian tubules, etc. conceptually)
- cellular control in unicellular organisms

---

### Diagram to draw (high-yield)
Three cells in three solutions:
- isotonic (normal)
- hypotonic (swollen/lysed for animal; turgid for plant)
- hypertonic (shriveled/plasmolyzed)

Label water arrows.

---

## 2.8 Mechanisms of Transport

### EK 2.8.A.1 ATP-powered pumps + gradients
ATP can power pumps that create gradients, and gradients can power co-transport.

#### What is the `Na⁺/K⁺ pump` doing?
- uses ATP
- moves `3 Na⁺` out
- moves `2 K⁺` in
Creates:
- concentration gradients
- electrical gradient (more + outside)

Why it matters:
- membrane potential
- nerve/muscle function (concept)
- secondary active transport

> AP focus: direction and purpose; not required: full nerve signaling physiology.

---

### What is secondary active transport?
Uses energy stored in an ion gradient (often Na⁺) to move another molecule uphill.

Example pattern:
- Na⁺ goes down its gradient through a cotransporter
- glucose is carried uphill into cell

---

### Diagram to draw
Two-step:
1) Na/K pump creating gradient
2) Na⁺ + glucose cotransporter using Na⁺ downhill to move glucose uphill

---

## 2.9 Cell Compartmentalization

### EK 2.9.A.1 Why compartments exist
Compartmentalization allows:
- incompatible reactions to occur simultaneously
- concentration control
- specialized environments (pH, ions)
- efficient enzyme pathways

### EK 2.9.B.1 Why membranes help
Membranes increase surface area and localize reactions.

Key example:
- inner mitochondrial membrane = platform for ETC + ATP synthesis

---

### What is “local environment” inside cells?
Different compartments have different:
- pH
- ion concentration
- enzyme sets
This changes reaction rates and enables regulation.

---

## 2.10 Origins of Cell Compartmentalization

### EK 2.10.A.1 Endosymbiosis
#### What is endosymbiosis?
A eukaryotic ancestor engulfed a prokaryote that survived and became an organelle.

Evidence (conceptual):
- double membranes
- own circular DNA
- ribosomes similar to bacteria
- replication independent of cell cycle

Organelles:
- `mitochondria`
- `chloroplasts`

> AP focus: evidence logic (not dates or exact phylogenies).

---

### EK 2.10.A.2 Prokaryotic internal regions
Even without membrane-bound organelles, prokaryotes have specialized regions (nucleoid, ribosomes, membrane infoldings).

### EK 2.10.A.3 Eukaryotic internal membranes
Internal membranes partition function → enables larger cell size and complexity.

---

## Mega-Comparison Tables (AP-style synthesis)

### Membrane Transport Decision Table
| Substance | Size/Polarity | Typical method |
|---|---|---|
| `O₂`, `CO₂` | small nonpolar | simple diffusion |
| `H₂O` | polar, small | osmosis / aquaporins |
| `Na⁺`, `K⁺` | ions | channels / pumps |
| glucose | large polar | carrier (facilitated) / cotransport |
| proteins | huge | endocytosis/exocytosis |

### Plant vs Animal Response to Hypotonic Solution
| Cell type | Result | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Animal | swelling/lysis risk | no wall |
| Plant | turgid (good) | wall resists expansion |

---

## End-of-Unit Mental Model
1) Cells are built from parts → each part has a job.  
2) Size creates constraints → SA:V and diffusion matter.  
3) Membranes create selectivity and gradients.  
4) Transport mechanisms maintain homeostasis.  
5) Compartments enable complexity.  
6) Endosymbiosis explains origin of key organelles.

---

## Optional “Reasoning Prompts” (light, but very AP)
- Explain how `cristae` relate to ATP production capacity.
- Predict what happens to a cell in a hypertonic solution and justify with water movement.
- A toxin blocks `aquaporins`. What changes first: solute movement or water movement? Why?
- A mutation prevents vesicles from fusing with the plasma membrane. Which process fails?
