# AP Biology – Unit 3 Study Guide (Mechanism-Heavy)
**Energetics: Enzymes, Cellular Energy, Photosynthesis, and Cellular Respiration**  
_Based on College Board CED + OpenStax Biology 2e_

> Design goal: This guide prioritizes **mechanism** (what is physically happening and why),
> while clearly marking what is **AP-tested** vs **for understanding only**.

## How to Read Diagrams in Unit 3 (Important)
Most diagrams in this unit are **energy flow diagrams** or **membrane-gradient diagrams**.
If you understand **energy levels, gradients, and coupling**, Unit 3 becomes much easier.

## TOPIC 3.1: Enzymes

### CED Core Idea
<*> `Enzymes` are protein catalysts that **lower activation energy** by stabilizing the transition state.
- increases reaction rate by lowering the energy barrier between the reactants and the products *without being **consumed***.

### What Is a Gibbs Free Energy Diagram?

A `Gibbs free energy diagram` visualizes **energetic feasibility**, not speed.
You’ll often see a graph like this:

```
Free Energy (G)
│            /\   ← activation energy (Ea)
│           /  \________/    \_______
│ Reactants        Products
└────────────────────────── Reaction progress
```
#### How to Read It?
   - **Y-axis (G)** = Gibbs free energy (usable energy)
   - **X-axis** = reaction progress (NOT time)
   - **Peak** = activation energy barrier
   - **Difference between start & end** = ΔG

#### Key Rules
   - Enzymes **lower** activation energy
   - Enzymes **do NOT change ΔG**
   - Enzymes **do NOT change reactants or products**

> ✅ AP Exam Focus: interpreting energy diagrams  
> ❌ AP Exam does NOT require Gibbs free energy equations

### OpenStax: How Enzymes Lower Activation Energy

#### Enzymes work by:
1. Orienting substrates correctly
2. Straining bonds (making them easier to break)
3. Creating microenvironments (acidic/basic regions)
4. Stabilizing the transition state

#### Induced Fit Model
- Active site is flexible
- Shape changes *after* substrate binds
- Increases reaction efficiency

<?> Why does lowering activation energy increase reaction rate but not affect equilibrium position?

### Diagram to Draw
- Energy diagram with:
  - Uncatalyzed curve (high peak)
  - Catalyzed curve (lower peak)
- Label: Ea, ΔG, enzyme-substrate complex

## TOPIC 3.2 — Environmental Impacts on Enzyme Function

### Denaturation?

`Denaturation` of proteins, such as enzymes, is when the protein is eliminated with the ability to catalyze reactions, due to a disruption in protein structure by a change in temperature, pH, or chemical environment. 

```
disrupt H-bonds → change in structure → 
active site shape altered → 
decrease function / efficiency = denaturation
```

### Temperature
- ↑ temperature → ↑ molecular motion → ↑ collisions \
⟹ increase in the rate of reaction until the optimal temerature is achieved
- outside optimal range → **H bonds disrupted** → denaturation


### pH
- Alters charge of amino acid R-groups
- Changes **ionic & hydrogen bonds**
- Active site shape changes → reduced function

#### Inhibitors
| Type | Where it binds | Effect |
|----|----|----|
| Competitive | Active site | Competes with substrate |
| Noncompetitive | Allosteric site | Changes enzyme shape 

### Diagram to Draw
- Reaction rate vs temperature curve
- Competitive vs noncompetitive enzyme diagrams

## TOPIC 3.3 — Cellular Energy

### Energy and Living Things
All living systems require 
- an input of energy
- highly ordered system

life doesn't violate
- first/second laws of thermodynamics
   - input > loss
   - relese energy w/ intake of energy

### ATP: Why It Works

ATP hydrolysis:
```
ATP + H₂O → ADP + Pi + energy
```

### Why ATP is effective
- Negative charges repel → unstable
- Breaking phosphate bond releases energy
- Easily coupled to endergonic reactions

### Energy Coupling Diagram
Draw:
- Exergonic reaction driving
- Endergonic reaction
- ATP as intermediary

> ✅ AP Exam Focus: ATP coupling  
> ❌ AP Exam: Gibbs free energy calculations

## TOPIC 3.4 — Photosynthesis (Mechanism Version)

### Big Picture

`Photosynthesis` is the series of reactions that use carbon dioxide ($\textup{CO}_\textup{2}$), water ($\textup{H}_{\textup{2}}\textup{O}$), and light energy to make carbohydrates and oxygen ($\textup{O}_2$).
- capture light E (from the sun)
- produce sugars that can be
   - used in biological processes
   - stored

### Light Reactions (Thylakoid Membrane)

#### Step-by-Step Mechanism
1. **Photosystem II (PSII)**
   - Chlorophyll absorbs light
   - Water splits:
     ```
     2H₂O → O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻
     ```
2. **Electron Transport Chain**
   - Electrons lose energy
   - Energy pumps H⁺ into thylakoid lumen
3. **Photosystem I (PSI)**
   - Electrons re-energized
   - NADP⁺ → NADPH
4. **ATP Synthase**
   - H⁺ flows down gradient
   - ADP + Pi → ATP (photophosphorylation)

### Diagram to Draw (Like Your Image)
- Thylakoid membrane
- Lumen (high H⁺) vs stroma (low H⁺)
- PSII → ETC → PSI → NADPH
- ATP synthase

> ✅ AP Exam Focus: proton gradient & ATP synthase  
> ❌ AP Exam: ETC protein names

## Calvin Cycle (Understanding-Focused)

### Three Phases
1. **Carbon Fixation**
   - Enzyme: **RuBisCO**
   - CO₂ attached to RuBP
2. **Reduction**
   - Uses ATP + NADPH
   - Produces G3P
3. **Regeneration**
   - ATP regenerates RuBP

> ❌ AP Exam does NOT require enzyme memorization  
> ✅ Understanding RuBisCO helps conceptually

### Diagram to Draw
- Circular cycle
- Label: CO₂ input, ATP/NADPH use, G3P output

# TOPIC 3.5 — Cellular Respiration (Mechanism Version)

## Big Picture
Cellular respiration = **energy in glucose → proton gradient → ATP**

---

## Electron Transport Chain (Mitochondria)

### Step-by-Step
1. NADH/FADH₂ donate electrons
2. Electrons pass through ETC complexes
3. Energy pumps H⁺ into intermembrane space
4. O₂ is final electron acceptor:
   ```
   O₂ + 2e⁻ + 2H⁺ → H₂O
   ```
5. Proton gradient powers ATP synthase

### Chemiosmosis
- High H⁺ outside matrix
- Low H⁺ inside matrix
- Flow through ATP synthase produces ATP

### Diagram to Draw (Your Style)
- Inner mitochondrial membrane
- Matrix vs intermembrane space
- ETC + ATP synthase
- Proton gradient arrows

---

## Fermentation (Why It Exists)
- No oxygen → ETC stops
- NAD⁺ must be regenerated
- Fermentation restores NAD⁺
- Glycolysis continues

> ❌ AP Exam: exact fermentation pathways

---

## Cross-Unit Connections (AP Loves This)
- ETC + ATP synthase appear in:
  - Photosynthesis
  - Cellular respiration
- Chemiosmosis = universal energy mechanism
- Conserved pathways = evidence of evolution

---

## Summary Mental Model
**Energy flows downhill → gradients form → gradients do work**
