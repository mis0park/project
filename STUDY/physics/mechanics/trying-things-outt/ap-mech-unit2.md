# UNIT 2 — FORCE AND TRANSLATIONAL DYNAMICS

**Unit focus:**  
Explain changes in motion using **forces**, **free-body diagrams**, and **Newton’s laws**.

## 2.1 Forces and Free-Body Diagrams

**Essential Knowledge: 2.1.A**

- A **force** is an interaction that can change an object’s motion.
- Forces are vectors and must be represented with **magnitude and direction**.

**Essential Knowledge: 2.1.B**

- A **free-body diagram (FBD)** represents all external forces acting on a single object.

**CED emphasis:**  
Only forces **acting on the object** appear in its FBD — not forces the object exerts on others.

**Common forces (OpenStax-supported descriptions):**
- **Gravitational force:** $F_g = mg$
- **Normal force:** perpendicular to contact surface
- **Tension:** along a rope or string
- **Friction:** opposes relative motion or tendency of motion

### 2.2 Newton’s First Law

**Essential Knowledge: 2.2.A**

- If the **net force** on an object is zero, its velocity remains constant.

Mathematically:
$$
\sum \vec{F} = 0 \Rightarrow \vec{v} = \text{constant}
$$

**OpenStax-supported insight:**  
This law defines **inertial reference frames**.

### 2.3 Newton’s Second Law

**Essential Knowledge: 2.3.A**

- The acceleration of an object is determined by the **net force** acting on it:
$$
\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a}
$$

**Essential Knowledge: 2.3.B**

- This law applies **component-by-component**:
$$
\sum F_x = ma_x,\quad \sum F_y = ma_y
$$

**CED emphasis:**  
Acceleration always points in the direction of the net force, not necessarily the direction of motion.

**OpenStax-supported insight:**  
An object can move in one direction while accelerating in another (e.g., circular or projectile motion).

### 2.4 Newton’s Third Law

**Essential Knowledge: 2.4.A**

- Forces occur in **pairs**:
  - equal in magnitude
  - opposite in direction
  - acting on **different objects**

**CED emphasis:**  
Third-law pairs **never cancel** because they act on different objects.

**OpenStax clarification:**  
Confusing interaction pairs with force balance is a common conceptual error.
