## TOPIC 4.3: Conservation of Linear Momentum
> LO 4.3.A: Describe the behavior of a system using conservation of linear momentum. 

### EK 4.3.A.1
- A collection of ojbects with individual momenta can be described as one system with one center-of-mass velocity. 
i. For a *collection* of objects, the velocity of a system's center of mass can be calculated using the equation:
$$
\vec{v_{\textup{cm}}} = \dfrac{\sum{\vec{p_i}}}{\sum{m_i}} = \dfrac{\sum{({m_i\vec{v_i}})}}{\sum{m_i}}.
$$
