## Topic 1.1 — Structure of Water and Hydrogen Bonding

### You Must Be Able To (CED verbs)
- Identify properties of water
- Describe hydrogen bonding
- Explain how water’s properties support life
- Predict effects of disrupting hydrogen bonds

### Essential Knowledge 1.1.A

**EK 1.1.A.1 Polarity and hydrogen bonding**
- Water is polar due to unequal electron sharing between oxygen and hydrogen.
- Partial charges allow **hydrogen bonds** to form between molecules.
- Hydrogen bonding gives water high specific heat capacity and high heat of vaporization.

**Biological consequences (cause → effect)**
- High specific heat → resistance to temperature change → stable internal/external environments
- High heat of vaporization → evaporative cooling → temperature regulation

**EK 1.1.A.2 Emergent properties of hydrogen bonding**
- Hydrogen bonding produces:
  - Cohesion (water–water attraction)
  - Adhesion (water–other polar surfaces)
  - Surface tension (resistance at surface)

**Do not say on AP**
- Hydrogen bonds are covalent ❌

### Required vocabulary (CED wording)
```text
| Term            | Definition                                                   |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Polarity        | Unequal distribution of electrons leading to partial charges |

## Topic 1.4 — Properties of Biological Macromolecules

### You Must Be Able To
- Explain how structure determines function
- Compare macromolecule classes

### Macromolecule overview
```text
| Macromolecule | Monomer        | Primary functions                    |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Carbohydrate  | Monosaccharide | Energy storage; structural support   |
| Lipid         | Fatty acids    | Energy storage; membranes; signaling |
| Protein       | Amino acids    | Catalysis; structure; transport      |
| Nucleic acid  | Nucleotides    | Information storage and transfer     |
```

## Topic 1.5 — Structure and Function of Carbohydrates

### Essential Knowledge 1.5.A
- Carbohydrates consist of monosaccharides linked by covalent bonds.
- Polysaccharide structure determines function.

### High-yield examples (function-focused)
```text
| Example   | Function                          |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Starch    | Energy storage (plants)           |
| Glycogen  | Energy storage (animals)          |
| Cellulose | Structural support (plant walls)  |
```

**Key comparison**
- Glycogen is highly branched → rapid glucose release
- Cellulose is linear → structural rigidity

## Topic 1.6 — Structure and Function of Lipids

### Essential Knowledge 1.6.A

**Structure**
- Lipids are largely nonpolar and hydrophobic.
- Fatty acids may be:
  - Saturated: no double bonds → straight chains
  - Unsaturated: ≥1 double bond → kinks

### Structure → physical state
- More double bonds → less packing → lower melting point → liquid

### Functions (what to say)
```text
| Lipid type     | Function                              |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Fats           | Long-term energy storage; insulation  |
| Phospholipids  | Membrane bilayers                     |
| Steroids       | Signaling molecules (hormones)        |
| Cholesterol    | Membrane stability/fluidity           |

|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Primary    | Amino acid sequence                         |
| Secondary  | Hydrogen bonding between backbone atoms     |
|            | - alpha-helix                               |
|            | - beta-plated sheets                        |
| Tertiary   | R-group interactions                        |
| Quaternary | Interactions between multiple polypeptides  |
```

**Core idea**
- Changes in sequence → changes in structure → changes in function

# Unit 1 Formula / Recall Sheet (EXAM-READY)

## Core relationships
- Polarity → hydrogen bonding → emergent properties of water
- Structure → function
- Monomers → polymers → macromolecules

## Must-know reactions
- **Dehydration synthesis**: builds polymers; releases water
- **Hydrolysis**: breaks polymers; uses water

## Lipid rules
- Unsaturated -> has double bond(s)
- More saturated -> more solid @RT
- More unsaturated -> more liquid @RT

## Nucleic acid rules
- Base pairing: A–T (DNA), A–U (RNA), C–G
- DNA is antiparallel
- New nucleotides add to 3′ end

## Protein rules
- Sequence determines structure
- Structure determines function
- R-group interactions drive folding
