## Topic 1.1 — Structure of Water and Hydrogen Bonding

### You Must Be Able To
- Identify properties of water
- Describe hydrogen bonding
- Explain how water’s properties support life
- Predict effects of disrupting hydrogen bonds

### Essential Knowledge 1.1.A
**EK 1.1.A.1 Polarity and hydrogen bonding**
- Water is **polar** due to unequal electron sharing between oxygen and hydrogen.
- Partial charges (polarity) allow **hydrogen bonding** between molecules.
- Hydrogen bonding gives water high specific heat capacity and high heat of vaporization.

**Biological consequences (cause → effect)**
- High specific heat → resistance to temperature change → stable internal/external environments
- High heat of vaporization → evaporative cooling → temperature regulation

**EK 1.1.A.2 Emergent properties of hydrogen bonding**
- Hydrogen bonding produces:
  - Cohesion (water–water attraction)
  - Adhesion (water–other polar surfaces)
  - Surface tension (resistance at surface)
  - High specific heat
  - High heat of vaporization

**CED extension (still Unit 1–legal)**
- Polar and charged substances interact favorably with water (**hydrophilic**).
- Nonpolar substances do not interact favorably with water (**hydrophobic**).
- Hydrophobic interactions contribute to membrane formation and protein folding.

## Topic 1.2 — Elements of Life

### You Must Be Able To
- Identify elements required by living systems
- Explain why carbon is uniquely suited for biological macromolecules

### Essential Knowledge
- Living systems require elements from the environment.
- Carbon forms **four covalent bonds**, enabling complex, diverse molecules.

| Element | Primary biological role              |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| C       | Backbone of organic molecules        |
| H       | Energy transfer; polarity            |
| O       | Polarity; respiration                |
| N       | Proteins; nucleic acids              |
| P       | ATP; nucleic acids; phospholipids    |
| S       | Protein structure (disulfide bonds)  |

**CED reasoning**
- Carbon’s bonding versatility → molecular diversity → functional complexity

## Topic 1.3 — Introduction to Biological Macromolecules

### You Must Be Able To
- Describe dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis
- Relate these reactions to polymer formation/breakdown

### Essential Knowledge 1.3.A
- Macromolecules are built from **monomers**.
- Monomers are linked by **covalent bonds**.

**Reactions**
- **Dehydration synthesis**: builds polymers; releases H₂O
- **Hydrolysis**: breaks polymers; uses H₂O

**Reactions**
- Dehydration synthesis → builds polymers; releases H₂O
- Hydrolysis → breaks polymers; uses H₂O

<!-- TikZ Diagram: Dehydration vs Hydrolysis -->

**CED framing**
- These reactions are **reversible**.
- Living systems regulate these reactions using enzymes (mechanism in Unit 3).

## Topic 1.4 — Properties of Biological Macromolecules

### Essential Knowledge 1.4.A
- Structure determines function for biological macromolecules.
- The shape of a molecule determines its interactions with other molecules.

```text
| Macromolecule | Monomer         | Primary functions                    |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Carbohydrate  | Monosaccharide  | Energy storage; structural support   |
| Lipid         | Fatty acids     | Energy storage; membranes; signaling |
| Protein       | Amino acids     | Catalysis; structure; transport      |
| Nucleic acid  | Nucleotides     | Information storage and transfer     |
```

## Topic 1.5 — Structure and Function of Carbohydrates

### Essential Knowledge 1.5.A
- Carbohydrates consist of monosaccharides linked by **glycosidic bonds**.
- Carbohydrate structure determines function.

### Structural variation (CED-tested)
- **Alpha (α) glycosidic linkages**
  - Found in starch and glycogen
  - Allow enzymes to easily hydrolyze bonds → energy storage
- **Beta (β) glycosidic linkages**
  - Found in cellulose
  - Form straight, rigid fibers → structural support

```text
| Polymer    | Linkage type | Function                    |
|------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Starch     | α            | Energy storage (plants)     |
| Glycogen   | α (branched) | Rapid energy release        |
| Cellulose  | β            | Structural support          |
```

**CED reasoning pattern**
- Branching → more ends → faster access to glucose

## Topic 1.6 — Structure and Function of Lipids

### Essential Knowledge 1.6.A
- Lipids are hydrophobic due to nonpolar hydrocarbon chains.
- Lipids are not true polymers.

### Fatty acid structure
- **Saturated fatty acids**
  - No double bonds
  - Straight chains → tighter packing → solid at room temperature
- **Unsaturated fatty acids**
  - One or more cis double bonds
  - Kinks → less packing → liquid at room temperature

```text
| Feature             | Saturated     | Unsaturated   |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Double bonds (cis)  | None          | ≥1            |
| Chain Shape (kinks) | Straight      | Bent          |
| Packing             | Loose         | Tight         |
| State @ RT          | Solid         | Liquid        |
| Membrane fluidity   | Decreases     | Increases     |
```

### Phospholipids (CED emphasis)
- Amphipathic molecules:
  - Hydrophilic phosphate head
  - Hydrophobic fatty acid tails
- Spontaneously form bilayers in aqueous environments → membrane structure

### Cholesterol
- Modulates membrane fluidity
- Prevents membranes from becoming too rigid or too fluid

## Topic 1.7 — Structure and Function of Proteins

### Essential Knowledge 1.7.A
- Proteins are polymers of amino acids joined by **peptide bonds**.
- Amino acid **R groups** determine folding and function.

```text
| Level      | Description                 | Stabilized by              | Structure change?  |
|------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| Primary    | Linear amino acid sequence  | Peptide bonds              | Rarely disrupted   |
| Secondary  | α-helix, β-pleated sheet    | Hydrogen bonds (backbone)  | Can be disrupted   |
| Tertiary   | Overall 3D structure        | R-group interactions       | Easily disrupted   |
| Quaternary | Multiple polypeptides       | R-group interactions       | Easily disrupted   |
```

**Denaturation**
- Loss of protein structure due to environmental change
- Disrupts secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure
- Reduces or eliminates function

## Topic 1.8 — Structure and Function of Nucleic Acids

### Essential Knowledge 1.8.A
- Nucleic acids store and transmit genetic information.
- Nucleotides are linked by **phosphodiester bonds**.

### Directionality
- Nucleic acids have 5′ and 3′ ends.
- Phosphodiester bonds form between 3′ OH and 5′ phosphate.

```text
| Feature | DNA          | RNA          |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Sugar   | Deoxyribose  | Ribose       |
| Base    | Thymine      | Uracil       |
| Strands | Double       | Single       |
```

**CED reasoning**
- Complementary base pairing → accurate information storage and transfer
