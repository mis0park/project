> **Unit 1 focus (how College Board tests it)**
> - Chemical properties → biological function
> - **Structure → function** at the molecular level
> - Energy storage, information storage, and system stability begin with chemistry

## Topic 1.1 — Structure of Water and Hydrogen Bonding

### You Must Be Able To (CED verbs)
- Identify properties of water
- Describe hydrogen bonding
- Explain how water’s properties support life
- Predict effects of disrupting hydrogen bonds

### Essential Knowledge 1.1.A

**EK 1.1.A.1 Polarity and hydrogen bonding**
- Water is polar due to unequal electron sharing between oxygen and hydrogen.
- Partial charges allow **hydrogen bonds** to form between molecules.
- Hydrogen bonding gives water high specific heat capacity and high heat of vaporization.

**Biological consequences (cause → effect)**
- High specific heat → resistance to temperature change → stable internal/external environments
- High heat of vaporization → evaporative cooling → temperature regulation

**EK 1.1.A.2 Emergent properties of hydrogen bonding**
- Hydrogen bonding produces:
  - Cohesion (water–water attraction)
  - Adhesion (water–other polar surfaces)
  - Surface tension (resistance at surface)

**CED extension (still Unit 1–legal)**
- Polar and charged substances interact favorably with water (**hydrophilic**).
- Nonpolar substances do not interact favorably with water (**hydrophobic**).
- Hydrophobic interactions contribute to membrane formation and protein folding.

## Topic 1.3 — Introduction to Biological Macromolecules

### Essential Knowledge 1.3.A
- Biological macromolecules are formed from smaller subunits (monomers).
- Covalent bonds link monomers to form polymers.

**Reactions**
- **Dehydration synthesis**: forms polymers; releases H₂O
- **Hydrolysis**: breaks polymers; uses H₂O

**CED framing**
- These reactions are **reversible**.
- Living systems regulate these reactions using enzymes (mechanism in Unit 3).

## Topic 1.4 — Properties of Biological Macromolecules

### Essential Knowledge 1.4.A
- Structure determines function for biological macromolecules.
- The shape of a molecule determines its interactions with other molecules.

```text
| Macromolecule | Monomer         | Primary functions                     |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Carbohydrate  | Monosaccharide  | Energy storage; structural support   |
| Lipid         | Fatty acids     | Energy storage; membranes; signaling |
| Protein       | Amino acids     | Catalysis; structure; transport      |
| Nucleic acid  | Nucleotides     | Information storage and transfer     |
```

## Topic 1.5 — Structure and Function of Carbohydrates (Expanded)

### Essential Knowledge 1.5.A
- Carbohydrates consist of monosaccharides linked by **glycosidic bonds**.
- Carbohydrate structure determines function.

### Structural variation (CED-tested)
- **Alpha (α) glycosidic linkages**
  - Found in starch and glycogen
  - Allow enzymes to easily hydrolyze bonds → energy storage
- **Beta (β) glycosidic linkages**
  - Found in cellulose
  - Form straight, rigid fibers → structural support

```text
| Polymer     | Linkage type | Function                    |
|------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Starch     | α            | Energy storage (plants)     |
| Glycogen   | α (branched) | Rapid energy release        |
| Cellulose  | β            | Structural support          |
```

**CED reasoning pattern**
- Branching → more ends → faster access to glucose

## Topic 1.6 — Structure and Function of Lipids (Expanded)

### Essential Knowledge 1.6.A
- Lipids are hydrophobic due to nonpolar hydrocarbon chains.
- Lipids are not true polymers.

### Fatty acid structure
- **Saturated fatty acids**
  - No double bonds
  - Straight chains → tighter packing → solid at room temperature
- **Unsaturated fatty acids**
  - One or more cis double bonds
  - Kinks → less packing → liquid at room temperature

```text
| Feature        | Saturated          | Unsaturated        |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Double bonds  | None               | ≥1                 |
| Shape         | Straight           | Bent               |
| State @ RT    | Solid              | Liquid             |
```

### Phospholipids (CED emphasis)
- Amphipathic molecules:
  - Hydrophilic phosphate head
  - Hydrophobic fatty acid tails
- Spontaneously form bilayers in aqueous environments → membrane structure

### Cholesterol
- Modulates membrane fluidity
- Prevents membranes from becoming too rigid or too fluid

## Topic 1.7 — Structure and Function of Proteins (Expanded)

### Essential Knowledge 1.7.A
- Proteins are polymers of amino acids joined by **peptide bonds**.
- Amino acid **R groups** determine folding and function.

```text
| Level       | Description                                   | Stabilized by                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Primary    | Linear amino acid sequence                    | Peptide bonds                          |
| Secondary  | α-helix, β-pleated sheet                      | Hydrogen bonds (backbone)              |
| Tertiary   | Overall 3D shape                              | R-group interactions                   |
| Quaternary | Multiple polypeptides                         | R-group interactions                   |
```

**Denaturation**
- Loss of protein structure due to environmental change
- Disrupts secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure
- Reduces or eliminates function

## Topic 1.8 — Structure and Function of Nucleic Acids (Expanded)

### Essential Knowledge 1.8.A
- Nucleic acids store and transmit genetic information.
- Nucleotides are linked by **phosphodiester bonds**.

### Directionality
- Nucleic acids have 5′ and 3′ ends.
- Phosphodiester bonds form between 3′ OH and 5′ phosphate.

```text
| Feature | DNA          | RNA          |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Sugar  | Deoxyribose  | Ribose       |
| Base   | Thymine      | Uracil       |
| Strands| Double       | Single       |
```

**CED reasoning**
- Complementary base pairing → accurate information storage and transfer

# Unit 1 Recall Sheet (CED-aligned)

- Polarity → hydrogen bonding → emergent properties
- α vs β linkages → carbohydrate function
- Fatty acid saturation → membrane fluidity
- R-group interactions → protein folding
- Phosphodiester bonds → nucleic acid directionality
