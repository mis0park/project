> - Describe the mechanisms by which genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. 

### EK 6.3.A.1 
The sequence of the RNA bases, together with the structure of the RNA molecule, determines RNA function.
 - i) Messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules carry information from DNA in the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm.
 - ii) Distinct transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bind specific amino acids and have anticodon sequences that base pair with the codons of mRNA. tRNA is recruited to the ribosome during translation to generate the primary peptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence.
 - iii) Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules are functional building blocks of ribosomes. 

### EK 6.3.A.2 
RNA polymerases use a single template strand of DNA to direct the inclusion of bases in the newly formed RNA molecule. This process is known as transcription. 

### EK 6.3.A.3 
The enzyme RNA polymerase synthesizes mRNA molecules in the 5’ to 3’ direction by reading the template DNA strand in the 3’ to 5’ direction. 

### EK 6.3.A.4 
In eukaryotic cells the mRNA transcript undergoes a series of enzyme-mediated modifications.
 - i) The addition of a poly-A tail makes mRNA more stable.
 - ii) The addition of a GTP cap helps with ribosomal recognition.
 - iii) The excision of introns, along with the splicing and retention of exons, generates different versions of the resulting mature mRNA molecule. This process is known as alternative splicing.

### EK 6.4.A.1 
Translation of the mRNA to generate a polypeptide occurs on ribosomes that are present in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, as well as the cytoplasmic surface of the rough ER of eukaryotic cells. 

### EK 6.4.A.2 
In prokaryotic organisms, translation of the mRNA molecule occurs while it is being transcribed. 

### EK 6.4.A.3 
Translation involves many sequential steps, including initiation, elongation, and termination. The salient features of translation include:
- i) Translation is initiated when the rRNA in the ribosome interacts with the mRNA at the start codon (AUG, coding for the amino acid methionine).
- ii) The sequence of nucleotides on the mRNA is read in triplets, called codons.
- iii) Each codon encodes a specific amino acid, which can be deduced by using a genetic code chart. Many amino acids are encoded by more than one codon.
- iv) Nearly all living organisms use the same genetic code, which is evidence for the common ancestry of all living organisms.
- v) tRNA brings the correct amino acid to the place specified by the codon on the mRNA. 
- vi) The amino acid is transferred to the growing polypeptide chain. 
- vii) The process continues along the mRNA until a stop codon is reached.
- viii) Translation terminates with the release of the newly synthesized protein.

### EK 6.4.A.4 
Genetic information in retroviruses is a special case and has an alternate flow of information: from RNA to DNA, made possible by reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that copies the viral RNA genome into DNA. This DNA integrates into the host genome and is transcribed and translated for the assembly of new viral progeny.

### EK 6.5.A.1 
Regulatory sequences are stretches of DNA that interact with regulatory proteins to control transcription. Some genes are constitutively expressed, and others are inducible. 

### EK 6.5.A.2 
Epigenetic changes can affect gene expression through reversible modifications of DNA or histones. 

### EK 6.5.A.3 
The phenotype of a cell or an organism is determined by the combination of genes that are expressed and the levels at which they are expressed.

## TOPIC 6.7 Mutations  

> BIG IDEA 3 Information Storage and Transmission: Living systems store, retrieve, transmit, and respond to information essential to life processes. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 6.7.A 
> - Describe the various types of mutation. 

### EK 6.7.A.1 
Alterations in a DNA sequence are mutations that can cause changes in the type or amount of the protein produced and the consequent phenotype. DNA mutations can be beneficial, detrimental, or neutral based on the effect or the lack of effect they have on the resulting nucleic acid or protein and the phenotypes that are conferred by the protein.
 - i) Point mutations occur when one nucleotide has been substituted for a different nucleotide.
 - ii) Frameshift mutations occur when one or more nucleotides are inserted or deleted, causing the reading frame to be shifted.
 - iii) Nonsense mutations occur when there is a point mutation that causes a premature stop.
 - iv) Silent mutations occur when the change in the nucleotide sequence has no effect on the amino acid sequence. 

> EXCLUSION STATEMENT —Knowledge of specific mutations and their effects is beyond the scope of the AP Exam. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 6.7.B 
> - Explain how changes in genotype may result in changes in phenotype. 

### EK 6.7.B.1 
Errors in DNA replication or DNA repair mechanisms as well as external factors, including radiation and reactive chemicals, can cause random mutations in the DNA.
 - i) Whether a mutation is beneficial, detrimental, or neutral depends on the environmental context.
 - ii) Mutations are a source of genetic variation. 

### [OpenStax 18.1 | Mutation as a source of variation]
**mutation** = change in DNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles, or new genetic variation in any population

3 outcomes of mutation
- reduced fitness
- beneficial effect on fitness
- no effect on fitness

### EK 6.7.B.2 
Errors in mitosis or meiosis can result in changes in phenotype.
 - i) Changes in chromosome number resulting from nondisjunction often result in new phenotypes caused by triploidy (aneuploidy).
 - ii) Changes in chromosome number often result in disorders with developmental limitations.

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 6.7.C 
> - Explain how alterations in DNA sequences contribute to variation that can be subject to natural selection. 

### EK 6.7.C.1 
Changes in genotype may affect phenotypes that are subject to natural selection. Genetic changes that enhance survival and reproduction can be selected for by environmental conditions.
 - i) The horizontal acquisitions of genetic information in prokaryotes via transformation (uptake of DNA), transduction (viral transmission of genetic information), conjugation (cell-to-cell transfer of DNA), and transposition (movement of DNA segments within and between DNA molecules) increase genetic variation.
 - ii) Related viruses can recombine genetic information if they infect the same host cell.

## TOPIC 7.1 Introduction to Natural Selection 

> BIG IDEA 1 Evolution: The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.1.A 
> - Describe the causes of natural selection. 

### EK 7.1.A.1 
Natural selection is a major mechanism of evolution. 

### EK 7.1.A.2 
According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, competition for limited resources results in differential survival. Individuals with more favorable phenotypes are more likely to survive and produce more offspring, thus passing on those favorable traits to subsequent generations. 

### [OpenStax 18.1 | Natural selection]
#### Natural Selection
- "survival of the fittest"
- the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits. This leads to evolutionary change. 

### [OpenStax 18.1 | Causes of Natural Selection]
#### Causes of Natural Selection
three principles in nature
- most characteristics of organisms are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring
- more offspring are produced than are able to survive, so resources for survival and reproduction are limited => there is competition for resources
- offspring vary among each other in regard to their characteristics and those variations are inherited

Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the next generation. This will lead to change in populations over generations in a process that Darwin called descent with modification. Ultimately, natural selection leads to greater adaptation of the population to its local environment. It is the only mechanism known for adaptive evolution. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.1.B 
> - Explain how natural selection affects populations. 

### EK 7.1.B.1 
Evolutionary fitness is measured by reproductive success. 

### EK 7.1.B.2 
Biotic and abiotic environments can fluctuate, affecting the rate and direction of evolution. Different genetic variations can be selected in each generation. 

### [OpenStax 18.1 | Common misconception: populations evolve; evolution isn’t intentional]
"Organisms evolve in response to a change in an environment" -> lead to 2 types of misunderstandings:
1. a _population_ evolves in response to a changing environment (not individual organisms)
2. evolution is not intentional (a changed environment results in some individuals in the population benefitting and producing proportionally more offspring; this results in change in the population if the characteristics are genetically determined)

the variation that natural selection works on is already in a population and does not arise in response to an environmental change.

## TOPIC 7.2 Natural Selection 

> BIG IDEA 1 Evolution: The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.2.A 
> - Describe the importance of phenotypic variation in a population. 

### EK 7.2.A.1 
Natural selection acts on phenotypic variations in populations. 

### EK 7.2.A.2 
Environments change and apply selective pressures to populations. 

### EK 7.2.A.3 
Some phenotypic variations can increase or decrease the fitness of an organism in particular environments. 

### [OpenStax 18.1 | Processes and patterns: variation & adaptation]
**variation** = differences among individuals in a population  
**adaptation** = a heritable trait that helps an organism’s survival and reproduction in its present environment  

Natural selection can only take place if there is variation with a **genetic basis**
Scientists describe a population as “adapting” when a genetic variation increases (or maintains) the population’s **fitness** in its environment over time.

Trait favorability is context-dependent:
- whether a trait is favorable depends on current environmental conditions
- environments can change; the same trait is not always selected
=> if an environment changes, the preferred phenotype changes

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.2.B 
> - Explain how variation in molecules within cells connects to the fitness of an organism. 

### EK 7.2.B.1 
Variation in the number and types of molecules within cells can provide populations a greater ability to survive and reproduce in different environments. 
 
## TOPIC 7.3 Artificial Selection 

> BIG IDEA 1 Evolution: The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.3.A 
> - Explain how humans can affect diversity within a population. 

### EK 7.3.A.1 
Through artificial selection, humans affect variation in other species. 
 
## TOPIC 7.4 Population Genetics 

> BIG IDEA 1 Evolution: The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.4.A 
> - Explain how random occurrences affect the genetic makeup of a population. 

### EK 7.4.A.1 
Evolution is also driven by random occurrences.
 - i) Mutation is a random process that adds new genetic variation to a population.
 - ii) Genetic drift is a change in allele frequencies attributable to a nonselective process occurring in small populations.
 - iii) The bottleneck effect is a type of genetic drift that occurs when a population size is reduced to a small number of individuals for at least one generation.
 - iv) The founder effect is a type of genetic drift that occurs when a population is separated from other members of the population. The frequency of genes and traits will shift based on the genes in this new founder population.
 - v) Migration can result in gene flow (the addition or removal of alleles from a population). 

### [OpenStax 18.1 | Genetic diversity mechanisms]
genetic diversity comes from 2 mechanisms: mutation & sexual reproduction

**sexual reproduction** = unique combinations of alleles assemble to reproduce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes in each offspring

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.4.B 
> - Describe the role of random processes in the evolution of specific populations. 

### EK 7.4.B.1 
Random processes can lead to changes in allele frequencies in a population.
 - i) Mutations result in genetic variation, which provides phenotypes on which natural selection acts.
 - ii) Genetic drift can allow a small population to diverge from other populations of the same species.
 - iii) Gene flow between two populations prevents them from diverging into separate species. 
 
> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.4.C 
> - Describe the change in the genetic makeup of a population over time. 

### EK 7.4.C.1 
Changes in allele frequencies provide evidence for the occurrence of evolution in a population. 
 
## TOPIC 7.5 Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium 

> BIG IDEA 1 Evolution: The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.5.A 
> - Describe the conditions under which allele and genotype frequencies will change in populations. 

### EK 7.5.A.1 
The Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium is a model for describing and predicting allele frequencies in a non-evolving population. Conditions for a population or an allele to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium are:
 - i) A large population size 
 - ii) No migration
 - iii) No new mutations
 - iv) Random mating
 - v) No natural selection 
These conditions are never met, but they provide a valuable null hypothesis. 

### EK 7.5.A.2 
Allele frequencies in a nonevolving population can be calculated from genotype frequencies. RELEVANT EQUATIONS Hardy–Weinberg Equation— p p + + 2 q q =1 2 2 p q + =1, where: p = frequency of allele 1 in the population q = frequency of allele 2 in the population 
 
## TOPIC 7.6 Evidence of Evolution 

> BIG IDEA 1 Evolution: The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.6.A 
> - Describe the types of data that provide evidence for evolution. 

### EK 7.6.A.1 
Evolution is supported by scientific evidence from many disciplines (geographical, geological, physical, biochemical, and mathematical data). 

### [OpenStax 18.1 | Evidence: biogeography]
**biogeography** = using the geographic distribution of organisms to infer evolutionary history

The geographical distribution of organisms on the planet follows patterns that we can explain best by evolution in conjunction with tectonic plate movement over geological time. 

Broad groups that evolved before the supercontinent Pangaea broke up are found worldwide today. In contrast, groups that evolved after the breakup tend to be concentrated in specific regions, including the northern continents that once formed Laurasia and the southern continents that once formed Gondwana. For example, the plant family Proteaceae appears in Australia, southern Africa, and South America, which suggests its ancestors were widespread across Gondwana before it split apart.

ex) Marsupial diversification in Australia and the absence of other mammals reflect Australia’s long isolation. Australia has an abundance of **endemic species** — species found nowhere else — which is typical of islands whose isolation by expanses of water prevents species from migrating. Over time, these species diverge evolutionarily into new species that look very different from their ancestors that may exist on the mainland. 
ex) Australia's marsupials, the Galápagos' finches, and many species on the Hawaiian Islands are all unique to their one point of origin, yet they display distant relationships to ancestral species on mainlands.

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.6.B 
> - Explain how morphological, biochemical, and geological data provide evidence that organisms have changed over time. 

### EK 7.6.B.1 
Molecular, morphological, and genetic evidence from extant and extinct organisms adds to our understanding of evolution.
 - i) Fossils can be dated by a variety of methods. These include 1) the age of the rocks where a fossil is found; 2) the rate of decay of isotopes including carbon-14; and 3) geographical data.
 - ii) Morphological homologies, including vestigial structures, provide evidence of common ancestry. 

### [OpenStax 18.1 | Evidence: anatomy + embryology (homology, vestigial, convergence)]
**homologous structures** = structures in organisms that share the basic form  
ex) bones in human, dog, bird, and whale appendages all share the same overall construcution, resulting from their origin in a common ancestor's appendages. Over time, evolution led to changes in the bones' shapes and sizes in different species, but they have maintained the same overall layout. 

**vestigial structures** = nused structures in organisms that have no apparent function, and appear to be residual parts from a past common ancestor  
ex) wings on flightless virds, leaves on some cacti, hind leg bones in whales

**convergence of form in organisms that share similar environments**  
ex) arctic fox and ptarmigan; living in the arctic region have been selected for seasonal white phenotypes during winter to blend with the snow and ice; these similarities occur not because of their common ancestry, but because of similar selection pressures (benefits of predators not seeing them)

**enbryology** = the study of the anatomy of an organism's development to its adult form  
Mutational tweaking in the embryo can have such magnified consequences in the adult that embryo formation tends to be conserved. As a result, structures that are absent in some groups often appear in their embryonic forms and disappear when they reach the adult or juvenile form. For example, all vertebrate embryos, including humans, exhibit gill slits and tails at some point in their early development. These disappear in the adults of terrestrial groups but adult forms of aquatic groups such as fish and some amphibians maintain them. Great ape embryos, including humans, have a tail structure during their development that they lose when they are born. 

### EK 7.6.B.2 
A comparison of DNA nucleotide sequences and protein amino acid sequences provides evidence for evolution and common ancestry. 

### [OpenStax 18.1 | Evidence: molecular biology]
**molecular biology** = 
The molecular strucutres of life reflect descent with modification. DNA's universality reflects evidence of a common ancestor for all of life. Fundamental divisions in life between the genetic code, DNA replication, and expressions are reflected in major structural differences in otherwise conservative structures such as ribosome  components and membrane structures. In general, the relatedness of groups of organisms is reflected in the similarity of their DNA sequences - exactly the pattern that we would expect from descent and diversification from a common ancestor. 
DNA sequences have also shed light on some of the mechanisms of evolution. For example, it is clear that the evolution of new functions for proteins commonly occurs after gene duplication events that allow freely modifying one copy by mutation, selection, or drift, while the second copy continues to produce a functional protein. 
 
## TOPIC 7.7 Common Ancestry 

> BIG IDEA 1 Evolution: The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.7.A 
> - Describe structural and functional evidence on cellular and molecular levels that provides evidence for the common ancestry of all eukaryotes. 

### EK 7.7.A.1 
Structural and functional evidence indicates common ancestry of all eukaryotes. This evidence includes:
 - i) Membrane-bound organelles
 - ii) Linear chromosomes
 - iii) Genes that contain introns 
 
## TOPIC 7.8 Continuing Evolution 

> BIG IDEA 1 Evolution: The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.8.A 
> - Explain how evolution is an ongoing process in all living organisms. 

### EK 7.8.A.1 
All species have evolved and continue to evolve. Examples include:
 - i) Genomic changes over time
 - ii) Continuous change in the fossil record
 - iii) Evolution of resistance to antibiotics, pesticides, herbicides, or chemotherapy drugs
 - iv) Pathogens evolving and causing emergent diseases 

### [OpenStax 18.1 | Ongoing evolution: antibiotic resistance + evolution isn’t goal-directed]
the variation that natural selection works on is already in a population and does not arise in response to an environmental change. For exapmle, applying antibiotics to a population of bacteria will(, over time,) select a population of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. The resistance, which a gene causes, did not arise by mutation because of applying the antibiotic. The gene for resistance was already present in the bacteria's gene pool, likely at a low frequency. The antibiotic, which kills the bacterial cells without the resistance gene, strongly selects individuals that are resistant, since these would be the only ones that survived and divided. Experiments have demonstrated that mutations for antibiotic resistance do not arise as a result of antibiotic application.

In a larger sense, evolution is not goal directed. Species do not become “better” over time. They simply track their changing environment with adaptations that maximize their reproduction in a particular environment at a particular time. Evolution has no goal of making faster, bigger, more complex, or even smarter species, despite the commonness of this kind of language in popular discourse. What characteristics evolve in a species are a function of the variation present and the environment, both of which are constantly changing in a nondirectional way. A trait that fits in one environment at one time may well be fatal at some point in the future. This holds equally well for insect and human species.
 
## TOPIC 7.9 Phylogeny 

> BIG IDEA 1 Evolution: The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.9.A 
> - Describe the types of evidence that can be used to infer an evolutionary relationship. 

### EK 7.9.A.1 
Phylogenetic trees and cladograms show hypothetical evolutionary relationships among lineages that can be tested. 

### EK 7.9.A.2 
Phylogenetic trees show the amount of change over time calibrated by fossils or a molecular clock, whereas cladograms do not show time scale or the evolutionary difference between groups. 

### EK 7.9.A.3 
Traits that are either gained or lost during evolution can be used to construct phylogenetic trees and cladograms. The out-group represents the lineage that is least closely related to the remainder of the organisms in the phylogenetic tree or cladogram.
 - i) Shared derived characters can be present in more than one lineage and indicate common ancestry. These are informative for the construction of phylogenetic trees and cladograms.
 - ii) Molecular data typically provide more accurate and reliable evidence than morphological traits in the construction of phylogenetic trees and cladograms. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.9.B 
> - Explain how phylogenetic trees and cladograms can be used to infer evolutionary relatedness. 

### EK 7.9.B.1 
Phylogenetic trees and cladograms can be used to illustrate speciation that has occurred. The nodes on a tree represent the most recent common ancestor of any two groups or lineages. 

### EK 7.9.B.2 
Phylogenetic trees and cladograms can be constructed from morphological similarities of living or fossil species and from DNA and protein sequence similarities. 

### EK 7.9.B.3 
Phylogenetic trees and cladograms represent hypotheses that are constantly being revised based on evidence. 
 
## TOPIC 7.10 Speciation 

> BIG IDEA 1 Evolution: The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.10.A 
> - Describe the conditions under which new species may arise. 

### EK 7.10.A.1 
Speciation occurs when two populations become reproductively isolated from each other. 

### [OpenStax 18.2 | Speciation definition]
**speciation** = the formation of two species from one original species.  
Given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation. 

For speciation to occur, two new populations must form from one original population and they must evolve in such a way that it becomes impossible for individuals from the new populations to interbreed.

### EK 7.10.A.2 
The biological species concept provides a commonly used definition of a species for sexually reproducing organisms. It states that species can be defined as a group capable of interbreeding and exchanging genetic information to produce viable, fertile offspring. 

### [OpenStax 18.2 | Species + hybrids]
**species** = a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile, viable offspring  
Members of the same species share both external and internal characteristics, which develop from their DNA.  
Species' appearance can be misleading in suggesting an ability or inability to mate.  
ex) domestic dogs = can interbreed and produce fertile puppies  
ex) bald eagles / African fish eagles = each belong to a separate group; if artificially mated, it would be infertile

**hybrid** = a cross between two species  
**infertile** = unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity

There are exceptions to this rule. Many species are similar enough that hybrid offspring are possible and may often occur in nature, but for the majority of species this rule generally holds. The presence in nature of hybrids between similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single interbreeding species, and the speciation process may not yet be completed.

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.10.B 
> - Describe the rate of evolution and speciation under different ecological conditions. 

### EK 7.10.B.1 
Punctuated equilibrium is when evolution occurs rapidly after a long period of stasis. Gradualism is when evolution occurs slowly over hundreds of thousands or millions of years. 

### [OpenStax 18.3 | Varying rates of speciation (gradual vs punctuated)]
Speciation occurs over a span of evolutionary time, so when a new species arises, there is a transition period during which the closely related species continue to interact.

#### Gradual speciation model
Species diverge gradually over time in small steps.

#### Punctuated equilibrium model
A new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species, and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time afterward.  
We call this early change model punctuated equilibrium, because it begins with a punctuated or periodic change and then remains in balance afterward.  
While punctuated equilibrium suggests a faster tempo, it does not necessarily exclude gradualism.

#### What influences speciation rate?
Primary influencing factor on changes in speciation rate: **environmental conditions**  
Under some conditions, selection occurs quickly or radically.

#### Example intuition (from OpenStax 18.3)
Consider a species of snails that had been living with the same basic form for many thousands of years (layers of fossils would look similar for a long time).  
When a change in the environment takes place—such as a drop in the water level—a small number of organisms are separated from the rest in a brief period of time, essentially forming one large and one tiny population.  
The tiny population faces new environmental conditions; because its gene pool quickly became so small, any variation that surfaces and that aids in surviving the new conditions becomes the predominant form.

### EK 7.10.B.2 
Divergent evolution occurs when adaptation to new habitats results in phenotypic diversification. Speciation rates can be especially rapid during times of adaptive radiation as new habitats become available. 

### [OpenStax 18.2 | Adaptive radiation]
In some cases, a population of one species disperses throughout an area, and each finds a distinct niche or isolated habitat. Over time, the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species. We call this **adaptive radiation** because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin; thus, causing the species to radiate into several new ones.  
ex) island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands; the Hawaiian honeycreeper

### EK 7.10.B.3 
Convergent evolution occurs when similar selective pressures result in similar phenotypic adaptations in different populations or species. 

### [OpenStax 18.1 | Divergent vs convergent evolution]
**divergent evolution** = 2 species that evolve in diverse directions from a common point.  
**convergent evolution** = similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a recent common ancestry  
ex)  
flowering plants; differ in appearance, same morphology  
flight; flight has evolved in both bats and insects, have structured refered to as wings; however, bat and insect wings have evolved from very different original structures

> - Explain the processes and mechanisms that drive speciation. 

### EK 7.10.C.1 
Sympatric speciation occurs in populations with geographic overlap. Allopatric speciation occurs in populations that are geographically isolated. 

### [OpenStax 18.2 | Allopatric speciation (more detail)]
Isolation of populations leading to allopatric speciation can occur in a variety of ways. The nature of geographic separation necessary to isolate populations depends entirely on the organism's biology and its potential for dispersal. 

two categories of allopatric speciation:  
**dispersal** = when a few members of a species move to a new geographical already  
**vicariance** = when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms  
ex) spotted owls: northern spotted owl / Mexican spotted owl = genetic and phenotypic differences

The further the distance between the two groups that were once the same species, the more likely it is that speciation will occur. Because as distance increases, the various environmental factors would likely have less in common than the locations in close proximity. 

### [OpenStax 18.2 | Sympatric speciation via polyploidy]
**polyploidy** = a condition in which a cell or organism has an extra set, or sets, of chromosomes

One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. In a normal cell division event chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes. However, sometiems the pairs separate and the end cell product has extra sets of chromosomes in a condition that we call **polyploidy**. It results from an error in meiosis in which all of the chromosomes move into one cell instead of separating. 
<<Figure 18.14>> = polyploidy

Scientists have identified two main types of polyploidy that can lead to reproductive isolation of an individual in the polyploidy state. **Reproductive isolation** is the inability to interbreed. In some cases, a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition that we call **autopolyploidy**. 
**autopolyploidy** (auto- = "self") = multiple chromosomes from one's own species 

ex) Plant species with $2n = 6$ produces autopolyploid gametes that are also diploid ($2n = 6$, when they should be $n = 3$), the gametes now have twice as many chromosomes as they should have. These new gametes will be incompatible with the normal gametes that this plant species produces. However, they could either self-pollinate or reproduce with other autopolyploid plants with gametes having the same diploid number. In this way, sympatric speciation can occur quickly by forming offspring with $4n$ that we call a **tetraploid**. These individuals would immediately be able to reproduce only with those of this new kind and not those of the ancestral species. 
<<Figure 18.15>> = autopolyploidy

**allopolyploid** (allo- = "other") = occurs when gametes from two different species combine
The other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring that we call an **allopolyploid**. It takes two generations(, or two reproductive acts,) before the viable fertile hybrid results.
The cultivated forms of wheat, cotton, and tobacco plants are all allopolyploids. Although polyploidy occurs occasionally in animals, it takes place most commonly in plants. (Animals with any of the types of chromosomal aberrations that we describe here are unlikely to survive and produce normal offspring.) Scientists have discovered more than half of all plant species studied relate back to a species evolved through polyploidy. With such a high rate of polyploidy in plants, some scientists hypothesize that this mechanism takes place more as an adaptation than as an error. 
<<Figure 18.16>> = alloploidy

### [OpenStax 18.2 | habitat influence on speciation]
Sympatric speciation may also take place in ways other than polyploidy. 
For example, consider a fish species that lives in a lake. As the population grows, competition for food increases. Under pressure to find food, suppose that a group of these fish had the genetic flexibility to discover and feed off another resource that other fish did not use. What if this new food source was located at a different depth of the lake? Over time, those feeding on the second food source would interact more with each other than the other fish; therefore, they would breed together as well. Offspring of these fish would likely behave as their parents: feeding and living in the same area and keeping separate from the original population. If this group of fish continued to remain separate from the first population, eventually sympatric speciation might occur as more genetic differences accumulated between them.
This scenario does play out in nature, as do others that lead to reproductive isolation. One such place is Lake Victoria in Africa, famous for its sympatric speciation of cichlid fish. Researchers have found hundreds of sympatric speciation events in these fish, which have not only happened in great number, but also over a short period of time.
ex) cichlid fish population in Nicaragua; two types of cichlids live in the same geographic location but have come to have different morphologies that allow them to eat various food sources

### [OpenStax 18.3 | Reconnection (hybrid zones: reinforcement vs fusion vs stability)]
After speciation, two species may recombine or even continue interacting indefinitely. Individual organisms will mate with any nearby individual with whom they are capable of breeding.

#### Hybrid zone
We call an area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce, forming hybrids a _hybrid zone_.  
Over time, the hybrid zone may change depending on the fitness of the hybrids and the reproductive barriers.

#### Outcomes after reconnection
- If the hybrids are less fit than the parents, speciation reinforcement occurs, and the species continue to diverge until they can no longer mate and produce viable offspring.
- If reproductive barriers weaken, fusion occurs and the two species become one.
- Barriers remain the same if hybrids are fit and reproductive: stability may occur and hybridization continues.

Hybrids can be either less fit than the parents, more fit, or about the same. Usually hybrids tend to be less fit; therefore, such reproduction diminishes over time, nudging the two species to diverge further in a process we call _reinforcement_. Scientists use this term because the hybrids' low success reinforces the original speciation. If the hybrids are as fit or more fit than the parents, the two species may fuse back into one species. Scientists have also observed that sometimes two species will remain separate but also continue to interact to produce some individuals. Scientists classify this as stability because no real net change is taking place.  

### EK 7.10.C.2 
Various pre-zygotic and post-zygotic mechanisms can maintain reproductive isolation and prevent gene flow between populations. 

### [OpenStax 18.2 | Reproductive isolation (prezygotic vs postzygotic)]
Given enough time, the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction: if individuals of the two populations were brought together, mating would be less likely, but if mating occurred, offspring would be nonviable or infertile. Many types of diverging characters may affect the **reproductive isolation**, the ability to interbreed, of the two populations.
**reproductive isolation** = the ability of two populations to interbreed

Reproductive isolation can take place in a variety of ways. Scientists organize them into two groups: prezygotic barriers and postzygotic barriers. Recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg: the first cell of an organism's development that reproduces sexually. 
**prezygotic barrier** = a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place; includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction
**postzygotic barrier** = occurs after zygote formation; includes organisms that don’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile

#### prezygotic barriers = prevent reproduction entirely
Some types of prezygotic barriers prevent reproduction entirely. Many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year, often just annually. Differences in breeding schedules, which we call _temporal isolation_, can act as a form of reproductive isolation. 
ex) Two frog species inhabit the same area, but one reproduces from January to March; whereas, the other reproduces from March to May.
**temporal isolation** = difference in breeding schedules that can act as a form of reproductive isolation

In some cases, populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the same species' other populations. We call this situation _habitat isolation_. Reproduction with the parent species ceases, and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent. 
ex) A cricket population that was divided after a flood could no longer interact with each other. Over time, natural selection forces, mutation, and genetic drift will likely result in the two groups diverging. 
**habitat isolation** = populations of species that move or are moved to a new habitat in a place that no longer overlaps with the same species' other populations, acting as a form of reproductive isolation

**Behavioral isolation** = the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction 
ex) Male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females. Various firefly species display their lights differently. If a male of one species tried to attract the female of another, she would not recognize the light pattern and would not mate with the male.

Other prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevent fertilization from taking place. We call this a _gametic barrier_. 
**gametic barrier** = differences in gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevening fertilization from taking place

Similarly, in some cases closely related organisms try to mate, but their reproductive structures simply do not fit together. 
ex) Damselfly males of different species have differently shaped reproductive organs. If one species tries to mate with the female of another, their body parts simply do not fit together.
ex) In plants, certain structures aimed to attract one type of pollinator simultaneously prevent a different pollinator from accessing the pollen. The tunnel through which an animal must access nectar can vary widely in length and diameter, which prevents the plant from cross-pollinating with a different species.
**mechanical isolation** = the incompatibility of reproductive structures preventing reproduction

When fertilization takes place and a zygote forms, postzygotic barriers can prevent reproduction. Hybrid individuals in many cases cannot form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages. We call this _hybrid inviability_ because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable. In another postzygotic situation, reproduction leads to hybrid birth and growth that is sterile. Therefore, the organisms are unable to reproduce offspring of their own. We call this _hybrid sterility_.
**hybrid inviability** = hybrid individuals unable to be formed normally in the womb and unable to survive past the embryonic stages
**hybrid sterility** = hybrid individuals unable to reproduce offspring of their own
 
## TOPIC 7.11 Variations in Populations 

> BIG IDEA 4 Systems Interactions: Biological systems interact, and these systems and their interactions exhibit complex properties. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.11.A 
> - Explain how the genetic diversity of a species or population affects its ability to withstand environmental pressures. 

### EK 7.11.A.1 
The level of variation in a population affects population dynamics.
 - i) The ability of a population to respond to changes in the environment is influenced by genetic diversity. Species and populations with little genetic diversity are at risk of decline or extinction.
 - ii) Genetically diverse populations are more resilient to environmental perturbation because they are more likely to contain individuals that can withstand the environmental pressure.
 - iii) Alleles that are adaptive in one environmental condition may be deleterious in another because of different selective pressures. 

### [OpenStax 18.1 | Variation depends on environment]
Whether or not a trait is favorable depends on the current environmental conditions. The same traits are not always selected because environmental conditions can change. 

==> if an environment changes, the preferred phenotype changes
 
## TOPIC 7.12 Origins of Life on Earth 

> BIG IDEA 4 Systems Interactions: Biological systems interact, and these systems and their interactions exhibit complex properties. 

> LEARNING OBJECTIVE 7.12.A 
> - Describe the scientific evidence that supports models of the origin of life on Earth. 

### EK 7.12.A.1 
The origin of life on Earth is supported by scientific evidence.
 - i) Geological evidence reinforces models of the origin of life on Earth.
 - ii) Earth formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago (bya). The environment was too hostile for life until about 3.9 bya, and the earliest fossil evidence for life dates to 3.5 bya. Taken together, this evidence provides a plausible range of dates for the origin of life. 
 
### EK 7.12.A.2 
The RNA world hypothesis proposes that RNA could have been the earliest genetic material. There are three assumptions:
 - i) At some point in time, genetic continuity was assured by the replication of RNA.
 - ii) Base-pairing is necessary for replication. 
 - iii) Genetically encoded proteins were not involved as catalysts.  

### [OpenStax 18.1 | Misconception boundary: evolution ≠ origin of life]
It is a common misunderstanding that evolution includes an explanation of life's origins. The theory does not try to explain the origins of life. The theory of evolution explains how populations change over time and how life diversifies the origin of species. 
However, once a mechanism of inheritance was in place in the form of a molecule like DNA either within a cell or pre-cell, these entities would be subject to the principle of natural selection. More effective reproducers would increase in frequency at the expense of inefficient reproducers. While evolution does not explain the origins of life, it may have something to say about some of the processes operating once pre-living entities acquired certain properties.
