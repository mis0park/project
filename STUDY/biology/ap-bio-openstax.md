## OpenStax 18.1 Understanding Evolution

### Natural Selection
- "survival of the fittest"
- the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits. This leads to evolutionary change. 

### Causes of Natural Selection?
three principles in nature
- most characteristics of organisms are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring
- more offspring are produced than are able to survive, so resources for survival and reproduction are limited => there is competition for resources
- offspring vary among each other in regard to their characteristics and those variations are inherited

Because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the next generation. This will lead to change in populations over generations in a process that Darwin called descent with modification. Ultimately, natural selection leads to greater adaptation of the population to its local environment. It is the only mechanism known for adaptive evolution. 

### Processes and Patterns of Evolution
variation = differences among individuals in a population
adaptation = a heritable trait that helps an organism's survival and reproduction in its present environment

Natural selection can only take place if there is variation that has some genetic basis

genetic diversity comes from 2 mechanisms: mutation & sexual reproduction
**mutation** = change in DNA, is the ultimate source of new alleles, or new genetic variation in any population

3 outcomes of mutation
- reduced fitness
- beneficial effect on fitness
- no effect on fitness

**sexual reproduction** = unique combinations of alleles assemble to reproduce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes in each offspring

Scientists describe groups of organisms adapting to their environment when a genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the population's fit to its environment.

Whether or not a trait is favorable depends on the current environmental conditions. The same traits are not always selected because environmental conditions can change. 

==> if an environment changes, the preferred phenotype changes

### Convergent vs. Divergent Evolution
**divergent evolution** = 2 species that evolve in diverse directions from a common point. 
**convergent evolution** = similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a recent common ancestry
ex) 
flowering plants; differ in appearance, same morphology
flight; flight has evolved in both bats and insects, have structured refered to as wings; however, bat and insect wings have evolved from very different original structures

### Evidence of Evolution
#### Fossils
Fossils provide solid evidence that organisms from the past are not the same as those today, and fossils show the gradual evolutionary changes over time. The resulting fossil record tells the story of the past and shows the evolution of form over millions of years. 
ex) Scientists have recovered highly detailed records showing the evolution of humans and horses. The whale flipper shares a similar morphology to bird and mammal appendages indicating that these species share a common ancestor.

#### Anatomy and Embryology
**homologous structures** = structures in organisms that share the basic form
ex) bones in human, dog, bird, and whale appendages all share the same overall construcution, resulting from their origin in a common ancestor's appendages. Over time, evolution led to changes in the bones' shapes and sizes in different species, but they have maintained the same overall layout. 

**vestigial structures** = nused structures in organisms that have no apparent function, and appear to be residual parts from a past common ancestor
ex) wings on flightless virds, leaves on some cacti, hind leg bones in whales

**convergence of form in organisms that share similar environments**
ex) arctic fox and ptarmigan; living in the arctic region have been selected for seasonal white phenotypes during winter to blend with the snow and ice; these similarities occur not because of their common ancestry, but because of similar selection pressures (benefits of predators not seeing them)

**enbryology** = the study of the anatomy of an organism's development to its adult form
Mutational tweaking in the embryo can have such magnified consequences in the adult that embryo formation tends to be conserved. As a result, structures that are absent in some groups often appear in their embryonic forms and disappear when they reach the adult or juvenile form. For example, all vertebrate embryos, including humans, exhibit gill slits and tails at some point in their early development. These disappear in the adults of terrestrial groups but adult forms of aquatic groups such as fish and some amphibians maintain them. Great ape embryos, including humans, have a tail structure during their development that they lose when they are born. 

#### Biogeography
**biogeography** 
The geographical distribution of organisms on the planet follows patterns that we can explain best by evolution in conjunction with tectonic plate movement over geological time. - Broad groups that evolved before the supercontinent Pangaea broke up are distrubuted worldwide. 
Groups that evolved since the greakup appear uniquely in regions of the planet, such as the unique flora and fauna of northern continents that formed the supercontinent Laurasia and of the southern continents that formed the supercontinent Gondwana. The presence of members of the plant family Proteaceae in Austrialia, southern Africa, and South America indicates that their ancestors were predominant on the supercontinent Gondwana prior to its breaking up. 

Marsupial diversification in Australia and the absence of other mammals reflect Australia’s long isolation. Australia has an abundance of endemic species—species found nowhere else—which is typical of islands whose isolation by expanses of water prevents species from migrating. Over time, these species diverge evolutionarily into new species that look very different from their ancestors that may exist on the mainland. Australia's marsupials, the Galápagos' finches, and many species on the Hawaiian Islands are all unique to their one point of origin, yet they display distant relationships to ancestral species on mainlands.

#### Molecular Biology
**molecular biology** = 
The molecular strucutres of life reflect descent with modification. DNA's universality reflects evidence of a common ancestor for all of life. Fundamental divisions in life between the genetic code, DNA replication, and expressions are reflected in major structural differences in otherwise conservative structures such as ribosome  components and membrane structures. In general, the relatedness of groups of organisms is reflected in the similarity of their DNA sequences - exactly the pattern that we would expect from descent and diversification from a common ancestor. 
DNA sequences have also shed light on some of the mechanisms of evolution. For example, it is clear that the evolution of new functions for proteins commonly occurs after gene duplication events that allow freely modifying one copy by mutation, selection, or drift, while the second copy continues to produce a functional protein. 

### Misconseptions of Evolution
#### Evolutions explain origins of life
It is a common misunderstanding that evolution includes an explanation of life's origins. The theory does not try to explain the origins of life. The theory of evolution explains how populations change over time and how life diversifies the origin of species. 
However, once a mechanism of inheritance was in place in the form of a molecule like DNA either within a cell or pre-cell, these entities would be subject to the principle of natural selection. More effective reproducers would increase in frequency at the expense of inefficient reproducers. While evolution does not explain the origins of life, it may have something to say about some of the processes operating once pre-living entities acquired certain properties. 

#### Organisms Evolve on Purpose
"Organisms evolve in response to a change in an environment" -> lead to 2 types of misunderstandings:
1. a _population_ evolves in response to a changing environment (not individual organisms)
2. evolution is not intentional (a changed environment results in some individuals in the population benefitting and producing proportionally more offspring; this results in change in the population if the characteristics are genetically determined)

the variation that natural selection works on is already in a population and does not arise in response to an environmental change. For exapmle, applying antibiotics to a population of bacteria will(, over time,) select a population of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. The resistance, which a gene causes, did not arise by mutation because of applying the antibiotic. The gene for resistance was already present in the bacteria's gene pool, likely at a low frequency. The antibiotic, which kills the bacterial cells without the resistance gene, strongly selects individuals that are resistant, since these would be the only ones that survived and divided. Experiments have demonstrated that mutations for antibiotic resistance do not arise as a result of antibiotic application.
In a larger sense, evolution is not goal directed. Species do not become “better” over time. They simply track their changing environment with adaptations that maximize their reproduction in a particular environment at a particular time. Evolution has no goal of making faster, bigger, more complex, or even smarter species, despite the commonness of this kind of language in popular discourse. What characteristics evolve in a species are a function of the variation present and the environment, both of which are constantly changing in a nondirectional way. A trait that fits in one environment at one time may well be fatal at some point in the future. This holds equally well for insect and human species.

## OpenStax 18.2 Formation of New Species

### Species and the ability to reproduce
> **species** = a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile, viable offspring

Members of the same species share both external and internal characteristics, which develop from their DNA.
Species' appearance can be misleading in suggesting an ability or inability to mate. \
ex) domestic dogs = can interbreed and produce fertile puppies \
ex) bald eagles / African fish eagles = each belong to a separate group; if artificially mated, it would be infertile

> **hybrid** = a cross between two species \
> **infertile** = unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity

### Speciation
The biological definition of **species**, which works for sexually reproducing organisms, is a group of actual or potential interbreeding individuals. 
There are exceptions to this rule. Many species are similar enough that hybrid offspring are possible and may often occur in nature, but for the majority of species this rule generally holds. The presence in nature of hybrids between similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single interbreeding species, and the speciation process may not yet be completed.

**speciation** = the formation of two species from one original species.
Given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation. 

For speciation to occur, two new populations must form from one original population and they must evolve in such a way that it becomes impossible for individuals from the new populations to interbreed. There are 2 broad categories:
**Allopatric speciation** (allo- = "other", -patric = "homeland") = involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution
**Sympatric speciation** (sym- = "same", -patric = "homeland") = involves speciation occuring within a parent species remaining in one location

### Allopatric Speciation
Isolation of populations leading to allopatric speciation can occur in a variety of ways. The nature of geographic separation necessary to isolate populations depends entirely on the organism's biology and its potential for dispersal. 

two categories of allopatric speciation:
**dispersal** = when a few members of a species move to a new geographical already
**vicariance** = when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms
ex) spotted owls: northern spotted owl / Mexican spotted owl = genetic and phenotypic differences

The further the distance between the two groups that were once the same species, the more likely it is that speciation will occur. Because as distance increases, the various environmental factors would likely have less in common than the locations in close proximity. 

In some cases, a population of one species disperses throughout an area, and each finds a distinct niche or isolated habitat. Over time, the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species. We call this **adaptive radiation** because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin; thus, causing the species to radiate into several new ones.
ex) island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands; the Hawaiian honeycreeper
<<Figure 18.13>>

### Sympatric Speciation
**polyploidy** = a condition in which a cell or organism has an extra set, or sets, of chromosomes

One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. In a normal cell division event chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes. However, sometiems the pairs separate and the end cell product has extra sets of chromosomes in a condition that we call **polyploidy**. It results from an error in meiosis in which all of the chromosomes move into one cell instead of separating. 
<<Figure 18.14>> = polyploidy

Scientists have identified two main types of polyploidy that can lead to reproductive isolation of an individual in the polyploidy state. **Reproductive isolation** is the inability to interbreed. In some cases, a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition that we call **autopolyploidy**. 
**autopolyploidy** (auto- = "self") = multiple chromosomes from one's own species 

ex) Plant species with $2n = 6$ produces autopolyploid gametes that are also diploid ($2n = 6$, when they should be $n = 3$), the gametes now have twice as many chromosomes as they should have. These new gametes will be incompatible with the normal gametes that this plant species produces. However, they could either self-pollinate or reproduce with other autopolyploid plants with gametes having the same diploid number. In this way, sympatric speciation can occur quickly by forming offspring with $4n$ that we call a **tetraploid**. These individuals would immediately be able to reproduce only with those of this new kind and not those of the ancestral species. 
<<Figure 18.15>> = autopolyploidy

**allopolyploid** (allo- = "other") = occurs when gametes from two different species combine
The other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring that we call an **allopolyploid**. It takes two generations(, or two reproductive acts,) before the viable fertile hybrid results.
The cultivated forms of wheat, cotton, and tobacco plants are all allopolyploids. Although polyploidy occurs occasionally in animals, it takes place most commonly in plants. (Animals with any of the types of chromosomal aberrations that we describe here are unlikely to survive and produce normal offspring.) Scientists have discovered more than half of all plant species studied relate back to a species evolved through polyploidy. With such a high rate of polyploidy in plants, some scientists hypothesize that this mechanism takes place more as an adaptation than as an error. 
<<Figure 18.16>> = alloploidy

### Reproductive Isolation
Given enough time, the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction: if individuals of the two populations were brought together, mating would be less likely, but if mating occurred, offspring would be nonviable or infertile. Many types of diverging characters may affect the **reproductive isolation**, the ability to interbreed, of the two populations.
**reproductive isolation** = the ability of two populations to interbreed

Reproductive isolation can take place in a variety of ways. Scientists organize them into two groups: prezygotic barriers and postzygotic barriers. Recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg: the first cell of an organism's development that reproduces sexually. 
**prezygotic barrier** = a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place; includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction
**postzygotic barrier** = occurs after zygote formation; includes organisms that don’t survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile

#### prezygotic barriers = prevent reproduction entirely
Some types of prezygotic barriers prevent reproduction entirely. Many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year, often just annually. Differences in breeding schedules, which we call _temporal isolation_, can act as a form of reproductive isolation. 
ex) Two frog species inhabit the same area, but one reproduces from January to March; whereas, the other reproduces from March to May.
**temporal isolation** = difference in breeding schedules that can act as a form of reproductive isolation

In some cases, populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the same species' other populations. We call this situation _habitat isolation_. Reproduction with the parent species ceases, and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent. 
ex) A cricket population that was divided after a flood could no longer interact with each other. Over time, natural selection forces, mutation, and genetic drift will likely result in the two groups diverging. 
**habitat isolation** = populations of species that move or are moved to a new habitat in a place that no longer overlaps with the same species' other populations, acting as a form of reproductive isolation

**Behavioral isolation** = the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction 
ex) Male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females. Various firefly species display their lights differently. If a male of one species tried to attract the female of another, she would not recognize the light pattern and would not mate with the male.

Other prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevent fertilization from taking place. We call this a _gametic barrier_. 
**gametic barrier** = differences in gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevening fertilization from taking place

Similarly, in some cases closely related organisms try to mate, but their reproductive structures simply do not fit together. 
ex) Damselfly males of different species have differently shaped reproductive organs. If one species tries to mate with the female of another, their body parts simply do not fit together.
ex) In plants, certain structures aimed to attract one type of pollinator simultaneously prevent a different pollinator from accessing the pollen. The tunnel through which an animal must access nectar can vary widely in length and diameter, which prevents the plant from cross-pollinating with a different species.
**mechanical isolation** = the incompatibility of reproductive structures preventing reproduction

When fertilization takes place and a zygote forms, postzygotic barriers can prevent reproduction. Hybrid individuals in many cases cannot form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages. We call this _hybrid inviability_ because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable. In another postzygotic situation, reproduction leads to hybrid birth and growth that is sterile. Therefore, the organisms are unable to reproduce offspring of their own. We call this _hybrid sterility_.
**hybrid inviability** = hybrid individuals unable to be formed normally in the womb and unable to survive past the embryonic stages
**hybrid sterility** = hybrid individuals unable to reproduce offspring of their own

#### habitat influence on speciation
Sympatric speciation may also take place in ways other than polyploidy. 
For example, consider a fish species that lives in a lake. As the population grows, competition for food increases. Under pressure to find food, suppose that a group of these fish had the genetic flexibility to discover and feed off another resource that other fish did not use. What if this new food source was located at a different depth of the lake? Over time, those feeding on the second food source would interact more with each other than the other fish; therefore, they would breed together as well. Offspring of these fish would likely behave as their parents: feeding and living in the same area and keeping separate from the original population. If this group of fish continued to remain separate from the first population, eventually sympatric speciation might occur as more genetic differences accumulated between them.
This scenario does play out in nature, as do others that lead to reproductive isolation. One such place is Lake Victoria in Africa, famous for its sympatric speciation of cichlid fish. Researchers have found hundreds of sympatric speciation events in these fish, which have not only happened in great number, but also over a short period of time.
ex) cichlid fish population in Nicaragua; two types of cichlids live in the same geographic location but have come to have different morphologies that allow them to eat various food sources

## OpenStax 18.3 Reconnection and Speication Rates 

Speciation occurs over a span of evolutionary time, so when a new species arises, there is a transition period during which the closely related species continue to interact. 

### Reconnection 
After speciation, two species may recombine or even continue interacting indefinitely. Individual organisms will mate with any nearby individual with whom they are capable of breeding. We call an area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce, forming hybrids a _hybrid zone_. Over time, the hybrid zone may change depending on the fitness of the hybrids and the reproductive barriers. 
If the hybrids are less fit than the parents, speciation reinforcement occurs, and the species continue to diverge until they can no longer mate and produce viable offspring. If reproductive barriers weaken, fusion occurs and the two species become one. Barriers remain the same if hybrids are fit and reproductive: stability may occur and hybridization continues. 
**hybrid zone** = an area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce, forming hybrids

Hybrids can be either less fit than the parents, more fit, or about the same. Usually hybrids tend to be less fit; therefore, such reproduction diminishes over time, nudging the two species to diverge further in a process we call _reinforcement_. Scientists use this term because the hybrids' low success reinforces the original speciation. If the hybrids are as fit or more fit than the parents, the two species may fuse back into one species. Scientists have also observed that sometimes two species will remain separate but also continue to interact to produce some individuals. Scientists classify this as stability because no real net change is taking place.  

### Varying Rates of Speciation 
Scientists around the world study speciation, documenting observations both of living organisms and those found in the fossil record. As their ideas take shape and as research reveals new details about how life evolves, they develop models to help explain speciation rates. In terms of how quickly speciation occurs, we can observe two current patterns: gradual speciation model and punctuated equilibrium model. 

In the _gradual speciation model_, species diverge gradually over time in small steps. In the _punctuated equilibrium model_, a new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species, and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time afterward. We call this early change model punctuated equilibrium, because it begins with a punctuated or periodic change and then remains in balance afterward. While punctuated equilibrium suggests a faster tempo, it does not necessarily exclude gradualism. 

The primary influencing factor on changes in speciation rate is environmental conditions. Under some conditions, selection occurs quickly or radically. Consider a species of snails that had been living with the same basic form for many thousands of years. Layers of their fossils would appear similar for a long time. When a change in the environment takes place—such as a drop in the water level—a small number of organisms are separated from the rest in a brief period of time, essentially forming one large and one tiny population. The tiny population faces new environmental conditions. Because its gene pool quickly became so small, any variation that surfaces and that aids in surviving the new conditions becomes the predominant form.

## OpenStax 19.1 Population Evolution

Scholars rediscovered Mendel’s work in the early twentieth century at which time geneticists were rapidly coming to an understanding of the basics of inheritance. Initially, the newly discovered particulate nature of genes made it difficult for biologists to understand how gradual evolution could occur. However, over the next few decades scientists integrated genetics and evolution in what became known as the _modern synthesis_ — the coherent understanding of the relationship between natural selection and genetics that took shape by the 1940s. 
**the modern synthesis** = describes how evolutionary processes, such as natural selection, can affect a population’s genetic makeup, and, in turn, how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species; also connects population change over time (microevolution), with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters (macroevolution)

### Population Genetics
A gene for a particular character may have several alleles, or variants, that code for different traits associated with that character.
ex) In the ABO blood type system in humans, three alleles determine the particular blood-type carbohydrate on the surface of red blood cells. 

Each individual in a population of diploid organisms can only carry two alleles for a particular gene, but more than two may be present in the individuals that comprise the population. Mendel followed alleles as they were inherited from parent to offspring. In the early twentieth century, biologists in the area of _population genetics_ began to study how selective forces change a population through changes in allele and genotypic frequencies.
**population genetics** = study of how selective forces change a population through changes in allele and genotypic frequencies

The _allele frequency_ (or gene frequency) is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population. Until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms, but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change. 
**allele frequency (gene frequency)** = the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population

In population genetics, scientists define the term evolution as a change in the allele's frequency in a population. 
ex) The ABO blood type system; the frequency of one of the alleles, $I^A$, is the number of copies of that allele divided by all the copies of the ABO gene in the population. For example, a study in Jordan found a frequency of $I^A$ to be 26.1 percent. The $I^{B}$ and $I^0$ alleles comprise 13.4 percent and 60.5 percent of the alleles respectively, and all of the frequencies added up to 100 percent. A change in this frequency over time would constitute evolution in the population. 
**evolution (in population genetics)** = change in the allele's frequency in a population

The allele frequency within a given population can change depending on environmental factors; therefore, certain alleles become more widespread than others during the natural selection process. Natural selection can alter the population’s genetic makeup. 
If a given allele confers a phenotype that allows an individual to better survive or have more offspring, many of those offspring will also carry the beneficial allele, and often the corresponding phenotype, they will have more offspring of their own that also carry the allele, thus, perpetuating the cycle. Over time, the allele will spread throughout the population. Some alleles will quickly become _fixed_ in this way, meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele, while detrimental mutations may be swiftly _eliminated_ if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool. The _gene pool_ is the sum of all the alleles in a population. 

####
Better survive -> more offspring -> offspring carry the gene/phenotype -> have more offspring
alleles becoming **fixed** = every individual of the population will carry the allele
detrimental mutations can be **eliminated** = if it derives from a dominant allele from the gene pool
**gene pool** = sum of all alleles in a population

Sometimes, allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over existing allele frequencies. We call this phenomenon _genetic drift_. Natural selection and genetic drift usually occur simultaneously in populations and are not isolated events. It is hard to determine which process dominates because it is often nearly impossible to determine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each occurrence. We call an event that initiates an allele frequency change in an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, the _founder effect_. Natural selection, random drift, and founder effects can lead to significant changes in a population's genome.

####
**genetic drift** = allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over existing allele frequencies
Natural selection and genetic drift occur simultaneously and not as isolated events
**founder effect** = an event that initiates an allele frequency change in an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population

### Hardy-Weinberg Principle of Equilibrium 
In the early twentieth century, English mathematician Godfrey Hardy and German physician Wilhelm Weinberg stated the principle of equilibrium to describe the population's genetic makeup. The theory, which later became known as the **Hardy-Weinberg principle of equilibrium**, states that a population’s allele and genotype frequencies are inherently stable—unless some kind of evolutionary force is acting upon the population, neither the allele nor the genotypic frequencies would change. The Hardy-Weinberg principle assumes an infinitely large population and conditions with no mutations, migration, emigration, or selective pressure for or against genotype. While no population can satisfy those conditions, the principle offers a useful model against which to compare real population changes. 

####
**Hardy-Weinberg principle of equilibrium** = a population’s allele and genotype frequencies are inherently stable; unless some kind of evolutionary force is acting upon the population, neither the allele nor the genotypic frequencies would change
- assumes an infinitely large population and conditions with no mutations, migration, emigration, or selective pressure for or against genotype
- offers a useful model against which to compare real population changes

Working under this theory, population geneticists represent different alleles as different variables in their mathematical models. The variable _p_, for example, often represents the frequency of a particular allele, say Y for the trait of yellow in Mendel’s peas, while the variable _q_ represents the frequency of y alleles that confer the color green. If these are the only two possible alleles for a given locus in the population, p + q = 1. In other words, all the p alleles and all the q alleles comprise all of the alleles for that locus in the population.


> **p** = frequency of a particular allele (Y for the yellow color in peas)
> **q** = frequency of the other allele (y for the green color in peas)
> **p + q = 1** = if **p** and **q** are the only 2 possible alleles for a given locus in the population, all the **p** alleles and the **q** alleles comprise all of the alleles for that locus in the population

However, what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles, but the frequencies of the resulting genotypes, known as the population’s _genetic structure_, from which scientists can surmise phenotype distribution. If we observe the phenotype, we can know only the homozygous recessive allele's genotype. The calculations provide an estimate of the remaining genotypes. Since each individual carries two alleles per gene, if we know the allele frequencies (p and q), predicting the genotypes' frequencies is a simple mathematical calculation to determine the probability of obtaining these genotypes if we draw two alleles at random from the gene pool. In the above scenario, an individual pea plant could be pp (YY), and thus produce yellow peas; pq (Yy), also yellow; or qq (yy), and thus produce green peas.  In other words, the frequency of pp individuals is simply $p^2$; the frequency of pq individuals is 2pq; and the frequency of qq individuals is $q^2$. Again, if p and q are the only two possible alleles for a given trait in the population, these genotypes frequencies will sum to one: $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$.

**genetic structure (of a population)** = frequency of the resulting genotypes

In theory, if a population is at equilibrium — that is, there are no evolutionary forces acting upon it — generation after generation would have the same gene pool and genetic structure, and these equations would all hold true all of the time. Of course, even Hardy and Weinberg recognized that no natural population is immune to evolution. Populations in nature are constantly changing in genetic makeup due to drift, mutation, possibly migration, and selection. As a result, the only way to determine the exact distribution of phenotypes in a population is to go out and count them. However, the Hardy-Weinberg principle gives scientists a mathematical baseline of a non-evolving population to which they can compare evolving populations and thereby infer what evolutionary forces might be at play. If the frequencies of alleles or genotypes deviate from the value expected from the Hardy-Weinberg equation, then the population is evolving.
