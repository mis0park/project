## Topic 2.2 — Cell Size (Surface Area-to-Volume)

### You Must Be Able To
- Explain how SA:V affects exchange with the environment
- Calculate SA, V, and SA:V
- Link calculations to biological effects

### Essential Knowledge 2.2.A (core idea)
- SA:V affects nutrient uptake, waste removal, heat exchange, and other exchanges with the environment.
- Plasma membrane SA must be large enough for adequate exchange.

### Key claim (test-ready)
- Size ↑ → **V increases faster than SA** → SA:V ↓ → exchange efficiency ↓

### KaTeX formulas
- Sphere:  
  \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), \(SA = 4\pi r^2\)
- Cube:  
  \(V = s^3\), \(SA = 6s^2\)
- Rectangular solid:  
  \(V = lwh\), \(SA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\)
- Cylinder:  
  \(V = \pi r^2 h\), \(SA = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r h\)

### What SA:V *means*
- \(\text{SA:V} = \frac{\text{exchange surface}}{\text{metabolic demand volume}}\)

### Evidence examples (use in explanations)
- Root hairs, microvilli, cilia, stomata/guard cells → structures that increase surface area.

### Mini-practice (no notes)
- If radius doubles, does SA:V increase or decrease? Explain with exponents.
