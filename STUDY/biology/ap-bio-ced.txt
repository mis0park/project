> - Explain how the properties of water that result from its polarity and hydrogen bonding affect its biological function. 

### EK 1.1.A.1 
 Living systems depend on the properties of water to sustain life.  
 - i) Water has polarity, because of the formation of polar covalent bonds between hydrogen and oxygen within water molecules. This polarity contributes to hydrogen bonding between and within biological molecules. 
 - ii) Water has a high specific heat capacity, which allows for the maintenance of homeostatic body temperature within living organisms.
 - iii) Water has a high heat of vaporization, which allows for the evaporative cooling of the surrounding environment. In living organisms, this property allows for body temperature to be maintained.

### EK 1.3.A.1 
 Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction involving the cleaving of covalent bonds. This type of reaction breaks down molecules into smaller molecules. When water is added to the bond between monomers in a polymer, the bond is broken. The hydrogen ion from a water molecule is added to one monomer and the hydroxyl group of the water molecule is added to the other monomer, completing the reaction. 

### EK 1.3.A.2 
 Dehydration synthesis occurs when two smaller molecules are joined together through covalent bonding. A hydrogen ion is removed from one monomer and a hydroxyl group is removed from the other. This causes the loss of the equivalent of a water molecule from the reactants and the connection of the two remaining monomers. The connection of many monomers is known as polymerization.

If a system is perturbed or disrupted, negative feedback mechanisms return the system back to its target set point. These processes operate at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels.
 - ii) Positive feedback mechanisms amplify responses and processes in biological organisms. The variable initiating the response is moved further away from the initial set point. Amplification occurs when the stimulus is further intensified, which, in turn, initiates an additional response that produces system change.

### EK 5.2.A.1 
 Correct separation of the homologous chromosomes in meiosis I and sister chromatids in meiosis II ensures that each gamete receives a haploid (1n) set of chromosomes that comprises an assortment of both maternal and paternal chromosomes. When incorrect separation occurs (nondisjunction), gametes are no longer haploid. 

### EK 5.2.A.2

 Mendel’s laws of segregation and independent assortment can be applied to genes that are on different chromosomes. 

### EK 5.3.A.2 
 In most cases, fertilization involves the fusion of two haploid gametes, restoring the diploid number of chromosomes and increasing genetic variation in populations by creating new combinations of alleles in the zygote.
 - i) Rules of probability can be applied to analyze the passing of single-gene traits from parent to offspring.
 - ii) Monohybrid, dihybrid, and test crosses can be used to determine whether alleles are dominant or recessive.
 - iii) An organism’s genotype is the set of alleles inherited for one or more genes by an individual organism. An organism’s genotype can be homozygous or heterozygous for each gene. 
 - iv) An organism’s phenotype is the observable expression of the inherited traits. v Patterns of inheritance (autosomal, genetically linked, sex-linked) and whether an allele is dominant or recessive can often be predicted from data, including pedigrees. Punnett squares can be used to predict the genotypes and phenotypes of parents and offspring. . RELEVANT EQUATIONS Laws of Probability: If A and B are mutually exclusive, then: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) If A and B are independent, then: P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)

### EK 5.4.A.1 
 Patterns of inheritance of many traits do not follow the ratios predicted by Mendel’s laws and can be identified by quantitative analysis, when the observed phenotypic ratios statistically differ from the predicted ratios.
 - i) Genes located on the same chromosome are referred to as being genetically linked. The probability that these linked genes segregate together during meiosis can be used to calculate the map distance (or map units) between them on a chromosome. This calculation is called gene or genetic mapping.
 - ii) Codominance occurs when the phenotype from both alleles is expressed such that the heterozygote would have a different phenotype than either homozygote.
 - iii) Incomplete dominance occurs when neither allele of a gene can mask the other, so the phenotype of the heterozygote is a blended version of the dominant and recessive phenotypes. 

### EK 5.4.A.2 
 Some traits, known as sex-linked traits (X- or Y-linked), are determined by genes on sex chromosomes. The pattern of inheritance of sex-linked traits can often be predicted from data, including pedigrees, indicating the genotypes and phenotypes of both parents and offspring. 

### EK 5.4.A.3 
 Pleiotropy is a phenomenon in which the expression of a single gene results in multiple traits or effects; these traits therefore do not segregate independently. 

### EK 5.4.A.4 
 Some traits result from non-nuclear inheritance.
 - i) Chloroplasts and mitochondria are randomly assorted to gametes and daughter cells; thus, traits determined by chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA do not follow simple Mendelian rules.
 - ii) In animals, mitochondria are usually transmitted by the egg and not by sperm; thus, traits determined by the mitochondrial DNA are typically maternally inherited.
 - iii) In plants, mitochondria and chloroplasts are transmitted in the ovule and not in the pollen; as such, mitochondria-determined and chloroplast-determined traits are typically maternally inherited.

### EK 6.4.A.2 
 In prokaryotic organisms, translation of the mRNA molecule occurs while it is being transcribed. 

### EK 6.4.A.3 
 Translation involves many sequential steps, including initiation, elongation, and termination. The salient features of translation include:
