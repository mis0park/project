## OpenStax 19.1 Population Evolution

**the modern synthesis** = describes how evolutionary processes, such as natural selection, can affect a population’s genetic makeup, and, in turn, how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species; also connects population change over time (microevolution), with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters (macroevolution)

### Population Genetics 
A gene for a particular character may have several alleles (variants) that code for different traits associated with that character. 
ex) for ABO blood type in humans: 3 alleles determine the particular blood-type carbohydrate on the surface of red blood cells

**population genetics** = study of how selective forces change a population through changes in allele and genotypic frequencies
**allele frequency (gene frequency)** = the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population
**evolution (in population genetics)** = change in the allele's frequency in a population

ex) for ABO blood type in humans:

| $I^A$ | $I^B$ | $I^O$ |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 26.1% | 13.4% | 60.5% |

= total 100%

The allele frequency within a given population can change depending on environmental factors; certain alleles become more widespread than others during the natural selection process. 

Better survive -> more offspring -> offspring carry the gene/phenotype -> have more offspring -> over time, the allele will spread throught the population

alleles becoming **fixed** = every individual of the population will carry the allele  
detrimental mutations can be **eliminated** = if it derives from a dominant allele from the gene pool  
**gene pool** = sum of all alleles in a population

Natural selection and genetic drift occur simultaneously and not as isolated events  
**genetic drift** = allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over existing allele frequencies  
**founder effect** = an event that initiates an allele frequency change in an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population

### Hardy-Weinberg Principle of Equilibrium 
**Hardy-Weinberg principle of equilibrium** = a population’s allele and genotype frequencies are inherently stable; unless some kind of evolutionary force is acting upon the population, neither the allele nor the genotypic frequencies would change
- assumes an infinitely large population and conditions with no mutations, migration, emigration, or selective pressure for or against genotype
- while no population can satisfy those conditions, the principle offers a useful model against which to compare real population changes

#### mathematical models used for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium theory
**p** = frequency of a particular allele (Y for the yellow color in peas)  
**q** = frequency of the other allele (y for the green color in peas)  
**p + q = 1** = if **p** and **q** are the only 2 possible alleles for a given locus in the population, all the **p** alleles and the **q** alleles comprise all of the alleles for that locus in the population  
**locus (plural = loci)** = the specific, fixed physical position of a gene or DNA sequence on a chromosome


What interests biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles, but the frequencies of the resulting genotypes. 
Observing just the phenotype = only know the homozyous recessive allele's genotype. 
If we know the allele's frequencies (p and q), predicting the genotypes' frequencies is a simple mathematical calculation. 
type  | pp (YY) | pq (Yy) | qq (yy)
------|---------|---------|--------
freq. | $p^2$   | $2pq$   | $q^2$

**$p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$** = if p and q are the only 2 possible alleles for a given trait in the Population
**genetic structure (of a population)** = frequency of the resulting genotypes
